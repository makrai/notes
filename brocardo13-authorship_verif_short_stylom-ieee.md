* three [perspectives:] Authorship 
  * attribution consists of determining the most likely author ... among a list
  * verification consists of checking whether a target document was written by
  * profiling or characterization consists of determining the characteristics
    (e.g. gender, age, and race) of the author of an anonymous document.
* Koppel et al. (2014), “verification is significantly more difficult than
  basic attribution and virtually no work has been done on it, outside the
  framework of plagiarism detection”
