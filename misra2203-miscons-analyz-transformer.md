* We present minicons, an open source library that provides a standard API for
  * analysis methods at the prediction and the representational levels:
  * pred: functions to efficiently extract word/sentence level probabilities;
  * repr: efficient extraction of word/phrase level vectors from 1/more layers.
* two motivating case studies:
  1. focusing on the learning dynamics of BERT on relative grammatical judgs
  2. benchmarking 23 different LMs on zero-shot abductive reasoning
