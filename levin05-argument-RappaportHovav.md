Argument Realization

# Introduction

* five major questions:
  1. Which facets of the meanings of verbs are relevant for the mapping
  1. lexical semantic representation
    * primitives ... and the principles for combining these
  1. the algorithm which derives the syntactic expression of arguments
  1. non-semantic factors such as
    information structure and heaviness
  1. To what extent are the semantic determinants ... lexical?
* This book
  * comparing different theories which address them
  * provide a bridge between the line of syntactic research that
    * presupposes a tight connection between verb meaning and synta[x] and
    * lexical semantic research into verb meanings
* [the] wide range of theoretical perspectives [...] hinders the pooling of
  important insights
* most of the determinants of argument realization are not strictly lexical
  * Borer 1994+ Erteschik-Shir and Rapoport 1996; Ghomeshi and Massam 1995;
    Goldberg 1995; Hoekstra 1992; Jackendoff 1997; Kay 2000;
    Ritter and S. T. Rosen 1996, 1998
  * syntactic configurations are themselves the bearers and determiners of
    certain meaning components; see section 7.1 for discussion

# Challenges for theories of argument realization

* the nature of a lexical semantic representation ... of verb meaning

## Taking lexical semantic representations seriously
## Identifying grammatically relevant facets of meaning
## The cross-classification of verbs and the status of verb classes
## Verb meanings represent construals of events
## Uniformity and variation in argument realization
## When subjects are not agents and objects are not patients
## Conclusion

# 2 Semantic role lists 35

## The properties common to semantic role list approaches
## Problems for semantic role list approaches
## Attempted solutions
## Conclusion

# 3 Current approaches to lexical semantic representation 51

* generalized semantic roles
* predicate decomposition
  * basic grammatically relevant elements of [verb] meaning
  * often called event structures
  * distinction between
    * simple and complex events
    * the core meaning of a verb – its root – and the
      components of meaning that identify the verb’s event type

## 3.1 Generalized semantic roles
## 3.2 Predicate decompositions and event structures
## 3.3 Conclusion

# 4 Three conceptualizations of events

* We focus on the last two approaches
* sentience ... is sometimes implicated in argument realization
  * cannot always be subsumed under causal notions [or] in aspect

## The localist approach
## The aspectual approach
## The causal approach
## The aspectual and causal approaches compared
## Conclusion

# The mapping from lexical semantics to syntax 131

* two hypotheses about which facets of event structure are preserved
* mapping ... preserves
  * equivalence classes of arguments or predicates [or]
  * prominence relations in the event structure

## Equivalence class preservation constraints
## Prominence preservation constraints
## Types of mapping algorithms
## Conclusion

# 6 Thematic hierarchies in argument realization 154

* [reasons for the prevalence of hierarchy theories]
  * prominence relations in the event structure are preserved in the syntax
  * recognizing priorities among meaning components relevant to [linking]
    * outside the structure of event structure

## Thematic hierarchies: appealing, but problematic
## The primary motivation for hierarchies: context dependence
## Formulations of the thematic hierarchy
## The grounding of the thematic hierarchy
## Towards an understanding of differences between thematic hierarchies

# 7 Multiple argument realization 186

* alternations ... as illustrated with the causative alternation
* some alternations appear to be meaning driven 
  (i.e., are a by-product of verbal polysemy)
* information status and heaviness of a verb’s arguments

## Projectionist and constructional perspectives
## Alternations involving a “single” set of arguments
## Information-packaging considerations and more
## Multiple argument realization involving event composition
## The distribution of verb classes in multiple argument realization
