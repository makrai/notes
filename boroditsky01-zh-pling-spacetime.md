Does language shape thought? English & Mandarin speakers' conceptions of time
Lera Boroditsky
(2001) Cognitive Psychology, 43 (1), 1-22.

# Abstract

* three experiments
* English and Mandarin talk about time differently
  * English predominantly talks about time as if it were horizontal, while
    Mandarin also commonly describes time as vertical
* reflected in the way their speakers think about time
* three experiments
  1. Mandarin speakers tended to think about time vertically
    even when they were thinking for English
    * faster to confirm that March comes earlier than April
      if they had just seen a vertical array of objects
      than if they had just seen a horizontal array, and the
      reverse was true for English speakers
  2. 2nd study showed that
    the extent to which Mandarin–English bilinguals think about time vertically
    is related to how old they were when they first began to learn English
  3. native English speakers were taught to talk about time
    using vertical spatial terms in a way similar to Mandarin
    * this group of English speakers showed the same bias to think about time
      vertically as was observed with Mandarin speakers
* concluded that
  * language is a powerful tool in shaping thought about abstract domains and
  * one’s native language plays an important role in shaping habitual thought
    (eg, how one tends to think about time) but does
    not entirely determine one’s thinking in the strong Whorfian sense.

# Intro

* people who speak different languages think about the world differently?
  * Does learning new languages change the way one thinks?
  * Do polyglots think differently when speaking different languages?
* This article briefly reviews the empirical history of these questions and
  describes three new experiments that demonstrate the role of language
  in shaping habitual thought.
* The doctrine of Linguistic Determinism—the idea that
  * thought is determined by language—is
  * most commonly associated with the writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf
  * the categories and distinctions of each language enshrine a way of
    perceiving, analyzing, and acting in the world
  * Insofar as languages differ, their speakers too should differ in
    how they perceive and act in objectively similar situations (Whorf, 1956)
* strong Whorfian view abandoned
    * strong Whorfian view: thought and action are entirely determined by lang
    * abandoned particularly because of work on color perception demonstrating
      the Dani (a tribe in New Guinea) had little trouble learning the English
      set of color categories, despite having only two words for colors
      (Heider, 1972; Rosch, 1975, 1978; but see Lucy & Shweder, 1979;
       Kay & Kempton, 1984).
* many weaker but still interesting formulations can be entertained
  * Slobin (1987, 1996) has suggested that
    language may influence thought during _thinking for speaking_
    * Languages force us to attend to certain aspects of our experience
      by making them grammatically obligatory
      => speakers of different languages may be biased to attend to and encode
      different aspects of their experience while speaking
  * Hunt and Agnoli (1991) reviewed evidence that language may influence
    by making habitual distinctions more fluent.
* domains that appear more likely to reveal linguistic influences
  than such low-level domains as color perception
  * cross-linguistic differences in the object-substance distinction
    in Yucatec Mayan and Japanese (eg, Gentner & Imai, 1997; Lucy, 1992)
  * effects of grammatical gender distinctions in Spanish
    (Sera, Berge, & del Castillo, 1994)
  * cross-linguistic differences in spatial thinking
    (eg, Bowerman, 1996; Levinson, 1996)
  * language influences conceptual development
    (eg, Markman & Hutchinson, 1984; Waxman & Kosowski, 1990).

# LIMITATIONS OF RECENT EVIDENCE

* serious limitations common to most recent studies of linguistic determinism.
  1. speakers are usually tested only in their native language
    * cannot tell us whether experience with a language affects language-indep
      thought such as thought for other languages or thought in nonling tasks.
  2. comparing studies conducted in different languages poses a deeper problem:
    * ? are the stimuli and instructions truly the same in both languages?
    * remains even if the verbal instructions are minimal
    * eg if the task is nonlinguistic and the instructions are simply
      _which one is the same?_, one cannot be sure that
      the words used for _same_ mean the same thing in both languages
    * If in one lang the word for _same_ is closer in meaning to _identical,_
      while in the other language it is closer to _relationally similar,_
      speakers of different languages may behave differently, but
      due only to the difference in instructions,
      not because of any interesting differences in thought
3. tasks are quite explicit.
    * even nonlinguistic tasks
      eg sorting into categories or making similarity judgments
    * require participants to decide on a strategy for completing the task
    * participants may simply make a
      conscious decision to follow the distinctions reinforced by their lang
* experience with a language affects thought in some broader sense (other than
  thinking for that particular language) would require observing a
  cross-linguistic difference on some implicit measure (eg, reaction time) in a
  non-language-specific task
  * we show an effect of first-language thinking on second-language understand
    using the implicit measure of reaction time
  * whether speakers of English and Mandarin Chinese think differently about
    the domain of time even when both groups are _thinking for English_

# TIME

* How is the domain of time learned, represented, and reasoned about?
  * From experience, we know that each moment in time only happens once, that
    we can only be in one place at one time, that we can never go back, and
    that many aspects of our experience are not permanent (ie, faculty meetings
    are not everlasting, but rather begin and end at certain times). In other
    * time is a phenomenon in which we, the observer, experience continuous
      unidirectional change that may be marked by appearance and disappearance
      of objects and events. These aspects of conceptual time
    * should be universal across cultures and languages.  Indeed, this appears
      to be the case. In order to capture the sequential order of events, time
      is generally conceived as a one-dimensional, directional entity
  * Across languages, the spatial terms imported to talk about time are also
    one-dimensional, directional terms such as ahead/behind or up/down
    rather than multidimensional or symmetric terms
    such as narrow/wide or left/right (Clark, 1973; Traugott, 1978)
    * Aspects of time that are extractable from world experience (temporally
      bounded events, unidirectional change, etc.) appear to be universal
* aspects of our concept of time that are not observable in the world
  * does time move horizontally or vertically? Does it move forward or back,
    left or right, up or down? Does it move past us, or do we move through it?
  * They are, however, specified in our language—most often spatial metaphors
    * looking forward to a brighter tomorrow, proposing theories ahead of their
      time, or falling behind schedule
      (Clark, 1973; Lehrer, 1990; Traugott, 1978)
  * free to vary across languages and
    our conceptions of them may be shaped by the way talk about them

## Time in English

* predominantly use front/back terms to talk about time
* _good times ahead of us, the hardships behind us, move meetings forward,
  push deadlines back, and eat dessert before we are done with our vegetables_
* the same terms as those used to describe asymmetric horizontal spatial rels
  (eg, _he took three steps forward_ or _the dumpster is behind the store_).

## Time in Mandarin Chinese

* front/back spatial metaphors for time are also common (Scott, 1989)
* 前 qián (`front`) and 后 hòu (`back`) to talk about time
* Fig. 1 show parallel uses of _qián_ and _hòu_ in their spatial and temporal

  Example sentences and their English glosses were taken from Scott (1989).

* Mandarin speakers also systematically use vertical metaphors for time
  (Scott, 1989)
  * 上 shàng (`up`) and 下 xià (`down`) are frequently used to talk about the
    order of events, weeks, months, semesters, and more
  * Earlier events are said to be _shàng_ or `up,` and
    later events are said to be _xià_ or `down.`
  * Examples in Fig. 2 show parallel uses of _shàng_ and _xià_ to describe
    spatial and temporal relations (examples taken from Scott, 1989).

* Although in English vertical spatial terms can also be used for time
  eg _hand down knowledge from generation to generation_ or _the meeting was
  coming up_), these uses are not nearly as common or systematic as is the use
  of _shàng_ and _xià_ in Mandarin (Chun, 1997a, 1997b; Scott, 1989).
* The closest English counterparts to the Mandarin uses of _shàng_ and _xià_
  are the terms _next (following)/last (previous) and earlier/later_
  * _Earlier_ and _later_ are similar to _shàng_ and _xià_ in that they use an
    absolute framework to determine the order of events
* direction, relative to what or absolute
  * absolute
    * time In Mandarin, _shàng_ always refers to events closer to the past, and
      _xià_ always refers to events closer to the future.
    * The same is true in English for _earlier_ and _later_ terms. This is
  * relative
    * not true, however, for the other English terms for time. Terms like
      _before/after, ahead/behind, and forward/back_ can be used
      not only to order events relative to the direction of motion of time, but
      also relative to the observer
    * before
      * relative to the dir of time:
        When ordering events relative to the direction of motion of time, we can
        say that Thursday is before Friday.  Here, before refers to an event that
        is closer to the past
      * rel to the obs
        But, we can also order events relative to the observer, as in
        _The best is before us._ Here, _before_ refers to an event closer to the
        future.
    * The same is true for ahead/behind and forward/back
    * Qián and hòu, the horizontal terms used in Mandarin to talk about time,
      also share this flexibility
  * absolute repeated
    * terms like earlier/later and shàng/xià are not used to order events
      relative to the observer. For example, one cannot say that _the meeting
      is earlier than us_ to mean that it is further in the future.
      Earlier/later and shàng/ xià are absolute terms.
* In summary, both Mandarin and English speakers use horizontal terms to talk
  about time. In addition, Mandarin speakers commonly use the vertical terms
  shàng and xià.1 1

# DOES LANGUAGE SHAPE THOUGHT?

* differences between the English and Mandarin ways of talking about time
* two separate issues: Does using spatial language to talk about time have
  short/long-term implications for on-line processing?

## Does Metaphor Use Have Implications for Online Processing?

* people do not just talk about time in spatial terms, but that
  they also use their spatial knowledge to think about time.
* Boroditsky (2000) showed that people are able to reuse relational infor made
  available by spatial primes to think about time. For example,
* priming a particular perspective for thinking about space biased how people
  later interpreted an ambiguous question about time. Also, spatial relational
  information was found to be just as useful for thinking about time as
  temporal information—in answering questions about time, subjects benefited
  equally from a spatial prime (129-ms benefit) as from a temporal prime
  (130-ms benefit). It appears that spatiotemporal metaphors do have
  implications for online conceptual processing.

## Does Metaphor Use Have Long-Term Implications for Processing?

* Boroditsky (2000) argued that spatial metaphors can provide relational
  structure to those aspects of time where the structure may not be obvious
  from world experience (eg, whether time should be vertical or horizontal).
  * Using spatial metaphors to describe time encourages structural alignment
    between the two domains and may cause relational structure to be imported
    from space to time
  * The mechanism for this type of metaphoric structuring may be the same as
    that used in analogical inference
    (Gentner, Bowdle, & Wolff, in press; Gentner & Wolff, 1997)
  * Language-encouraged mappings between space and time may then come to be
    stored in the domain of time
  * frequently invoked mappings may become habits of thought. For example,
    * because English/Mandarin speakers often use horizontal/vertical metaphors
      to talk about time, they might grow to think about time
      horizontally/horizontally even when not explicitly processing a
      spatiotemporal metaphor (eg earlier and later).
* Experiment 1 was designed to test
  whether using spatial metaphors to talk about time can have both immediate
  and long-term implications for how people think about time. Mandarin and
  * spatial priming question followed by a target question about time.  The
  * spatial primes were either about horizontal/vertical spatial relations
    between two objects (see Fig. 3a/b) or about vertical relations
  * TRUE/FALSE target question about time
    * Half of the target questions were designed to test the immediate effect
      of metaphors on processing and so used a horizontal spatiotemporal
      metaphor (eg, ‘‘March comes before April.’’). If horizontal
      spatiotemporal metaphors are processed by activating horizontal spatial
      knowledge, then people should be faster to understand such a metaphor if
      they have just seen a horizontal spatial prime (Fig. 3a) than if they
      have just seen a vertical prime (Fig. 3b)
    * other half of the target questions were designed to test the long-term
      effects of metaphor use on thinking about time and so did
      * not use a metaphor, but instead used the purely temporal terms
        _earlier_ and _later_ (eg, ‘‘March comes earlier than April’’)
* If the metaphors frequently used in one’s native language do have a long-term
  effect on how one thinks about time
  * ie use spatial knowledge to think about time in a way that is consistent
    with (and encouraged by) the particular metaphors popular
  * Mandarin/English speakers should be faster to answer purely temporal target
    qs (eg, ‘‘March comes earlier than April’’) after the vertical/horizontal
    spatial primes than after the horizontal/vertical spatial primes
* both English and Mandarin speakers completed the task in English, this is a
  particularly strong test of the effect of one’s native language on thought.
  * If Mandarin speakers do show a vertical bias in thinking about time even
    when they are ‘‘thinking for English,’’ then language must play an
