# Abstract

* three experiments
* English and Mandarin talk about time differently
  * English predominantly talks about time as if it were horizontal, while
    Mandarin also commonly describes time as vertical. This difference between
* reflected in the way their speakers think about time
1. study, Mandarin speakers tended to think about time vertically
  even when they were thinking for English (Mandarin speakers were
  * faster to confirm that March comes earlier than April
    if they had just seen a vertical array of objects
    than if they had just seen a horizontal array, and the
    reverse was true for English speakers).
2. study showed that
  the extent to which Mandarin–English bilinguals think about time vertically
  is related to how old they were when they first began to learn English. In
3. experiment native English speakers were taught to talk about time
  using vertical spatial terms in a way similar to Mandarin. On a subsequent
  * this group of English speakers showed the same bias to think about time
    vertically as was observed with Mandarin speakers
* concluded that 
  * language is a powerful tool in shaping thought about abstract domains and 
  * one’s native language plays an important role in shaping habitual thought
    (eg, how one tends to think about time) but does
    not entirely determine one’s thinking in the strong Whorfian sense.

# Intro

* people who speak different languages think about the world differently?
  * Does learning new languages change the way one thinks?
  * Do polyglots think differently when speaking different languages? Although
* This article briefly reviews the empirical history of these questions and
  describes three new experiments that demonstrate the role of language
  in shaping habitual thought.  
* The doctrine of Linguistic Determinism—the idea that
  * thought is determined by language—is
  * most commonly associated with the writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Whorf,
  * the categories and distinctions of each language enshrine a way of
    perceiving, analyzing, and acting in the world. Insofar as languages
    differ, their speakers too should differ in how they perceive and act in
    objectively similar situations (Whorf, 1956). This
* strong Whorfian view abandoned
    * strong Whorfian view: thought and action are entirely determined by lang
    * abandoned Particularly because of work on color perception demonstrating
      the Dani (a tribe in New Guinea) had little trouble learning the English
      set of color categories, despite having only two words for colors
      (Heider, 1972; Rosch, 1975, 1978; but see Lucy & Shweder, 1979; Kay &
      Kempton, 1984).
* many weaker but still interesting formulations can be entertained. For
  * Slobin (1987, 1996) has suggested that
    language may influence thought during _thinking for speaking._
    * Languages force us to attend to certain aspects of our experience
      by making them grammatically obligatory.  Therefore, speakers of
      different languages may be biased to attend to and encode different
      aspects of their experience while speaking. In a similar vein,
  * Hunt and Agnoli (1991) reviewed evidence that language may influence
    thought by making habitual distinctions more fluent.
* domains that appear more likely to reveal linguistic influences
  than such lowlevel domains as color perception. Among the evidence are
  * cross-linguistic differences in the object-substance distinction in Yucatec
    Mayan and Japanese (eg, Gentner & Imai, 1997; Lucy, 1992)
  * effects of grammatical gender distinctions in Spanish
    (Sera, Berge, & del Castillo, 1994)
  * cross-linguistic differences in spatial thinking
    (eg, Bowerman, 1996; Levinson, 1996)
  * language influences conceptual development
    (eg, Markman & Hutchinson, 1984; Waxman & Kosowski, 1990).

# LIMITATIONS OF RECENT EVIDENCE

* serious limitations common to most recent studies of linguistic determinism.
  1. speakers are usually tested only in their native language. Any differences
    * can only show the effect of a language on thinking for that partic lang
    * cannot tell us whether experience with a language affects language-indep
      thought such as thought for other languages or thought in nonling tasks.
  2. comparing studies conducted in different languages poses a deeper problem:
    * ? the stimuli and instructions are truly the same in both languages? This
    * remains even if the verbal instructions are minimal. For example, even
      * eg if the task is nonlinguistic and the instructions are simply _which
        one is the same?_, one cannot be sure that the words used for _same_
        mean the same thing in both languages. If
        in one lang the word for _same_ is closer in meaning to _identical,_
        while in the other language it is closer to _relationally similar,_
        speakers of different languages may behave differently, but
        due only to the difference in instructions,
        not because of any interesting differences in thought
  3. tasks are quite explicit.
    * even nonlinguistic tasks
      eg sorting into categories or making similarity judgments) Sorting and
    * require participants to decide on a strategy for completing the task. How
    * participants may simply make a conscious decision to follow the
      distinctions reinforced by their language.
* experience with a language affects thought in some broader sense (other than
  thinking for that particular language) would require observing a
  cross-linguistic difference on some implicit measure (eg, reaction time) in a
  non-language-specific task
  * we show an effect of first-language thinking on second-language
    understanding using the implicit measure of reaction time. In particular,
  * whether speakers of English and Mandarin Chinese think differently about
    the domain of time even when both groups are _thinking for English._

# TIME

* How is the domain of time learned, represented, and reasoned about? Certainly
  * From experience, we know that each moment in time only happens once, that
    we can only be in one place at one time, that we can never go back, and
    that many aspects of our experience are not permanent (ie, faculty meetings
    are not everlasting, but rather begin and end at certain times). In other
    * time is a phenomenon in which we, the observer, experience continuous
      unidirectional change that may be marked by appearance and disappearance
      of objects and events. These aspects of conceptual time
    * should be universal across cultures and languages.  Indeed, this appears
      to be the case. In order to capture the sequential order of events, time
      is generally conceived as a one-dimensional, directional entity
  * Across languages, the spatial terms imported to talk about time are also
    one-dimensional, directional terms such as ahead/behind or up/down
    rather than multidimensional or symmetric terms such as narrow/wide or
    left/right (Clark, 1973; Traugott, 1978). Aspects of time that are
    extractable from world experience (temporally bounded events,
    unidirectional change, etc.) appear to be universal across cultures and
    languages.

* aspects of our concept of time that are not observable in the world. For
  * does time move horizontally or vertically? Does it move forward or back,
    left or right, up or down? Does it move past us, or do we move through it?
  * They are, however, specified in our language—most often spatial metaphors
    * looking forward to a brighter tomorrow, proposing theories ahead of their
      time, or falling behind schedule
      (Clark, 1973; Lehrer, 1990; Traugott, 1978)
  * free to vary across languages and
    our conceptions of them may be shaped by the way talk about them

## Time in English

* predominantly use front/back terms to talk about time. We can talk about the
* good times ahead of us or the hardships behind us. We can move meetings
  forward, push deadlines back, and eat dessert before we are done with our
  vegetables. On the whole, the terms used to order events are 
* the same terms as those used to describe asymmetric horizontal spatial rels
  (eg, `he took three steps forward` or`the dumpster is behind the store`).

## Time in Mandarin Chinese

* front/back spatial metaphors for time are also common (Scott, 1989). Mandarin
* 前 qián (`front`) and 后 hòu (`back`) to talk about time. Examples in
* Fig. 1 show parallel uses of qián and hòu in their spatial and temporal

  Example sentences and their English glosses were taken from Scott (1989).

* Mandarin speakers also systematically use vertical metaphors for time
  (Scott, 1989)
  * 上 shàng (`up`) and 下 xià (`down`) are frequently used to talk about the
    order of events, weeks, months, semesters, and more
  * Earlier events are said to be shàng or `up,` and
    later events are said to be xià or `down.` 
  * Examples in Fig. 2 show parallel uses of shàng and xià to describe spatial
    and temporal relations (examples taken from Scott, 1989).

* Although in English vertical spatial terms can also be used for time (eg,
  `hand down knowledge from generation to generation` or `the meeting was
  coming up`), these uses are not nearly as common or systematic as is the use
  of shàng and xià in Mandarin (Chun, 1997a, 1997b; Scott, 1989).
* The closest English counterparts to the Mandarin uses of shàng and xià are
  the terms next (following)/last (previous) and earlier/later.
  * Earlier and later are similar to shàng and xià in that they use an
    absolute framework to determine the order of events
* direction, relative to what or absolute
  * In Mandarin, shàng always refers to events closer to the past, and xià
    always refers to events closer to the future.
  * en
    * The same is true in English for earlier and later terms. This is
    * not true, however, for the other English terms for time. Terms like
      before/after, ahead/behind, and forward/back can be used
      not only to order events relative to the direction of motion of time, but
      also relative to the observer. When ordering events relative to the
      direction of motion of time, we can say that Thursday is before Friday.
      Here, before refers to an event that is closer to the past. But, we can
      also order events relative to the observer, as in _The best is before
      us._ Here, _before_ refers to an event closer to the future. The same is
      true for ahead/behind and forward/back.  Qián and hòu, the horizontal
      terms used in Mandarin to talk about time, also share this flexibility.
      Unlike before/after, ahead/behind, and qián/hòu, terms like earlier/later
      and shàng/xià are not used to order events relative to the observer. For
      example, one cannot say that _the meeting is earlier than us_ to mean
      that it is further in the future. Earlier/later and shàng/ xià are
      absolute terms.
* In summary, both Mandarin and English speakers use horizontal terms to talk
  about time. In addition, Mandarin speakers commonly use the vertical terms
  shàng and xià.1 1
