# Abstract

* Humor is considered an adaptive coping strategy as it
  * could reduce the burden of perceived stress and
    increase positive emotional states when dealing with stressful situations
  * a rather independent strategy that can be correlated with both
    approach-based coping strategies and avoidance-based coping strategies
  * a hedonistic escapism strategy that would work better in the presence of
    unpredictable or uncontrollable stressors, such as
  * stressful event eg the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related
    confinement measures
  * during such a stressful event, humor would have increased the positive
    effect of the approach coping style on mental health and
    * reduced the negative effect of the avoidance coping style.  Based on this
* we: a cross-sectional study with a moderation analysis in which we assessed
  the interaction of humor with both approach-based and avoidance-based coping
  styles on perceived stress in a large sample of Italian participants
  collected in April and May 2021
  * limitations related to sampling and study design, the
  * results partially support our hypothesis, as we observed that
    humor had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between
    avoidance coping and psychological distress, with a reduction of perceived
    stress while using such a coping style in the presence of a medium to high
    level of humor
  * no significant moderating effect of humor on the relationship between the
    approach coping style and perceived stress
  * In general, our results support the
    beneficial effect of humor on mental health and highlight
    * a special role for humor as a moderator of other coping strategies
