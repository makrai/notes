# Abstract

* limitation of input and context length results in that 
  the whole article cannot be encoded completely. Motivated by the application
* we build an abstractive summarizer for long text and 
  * evaluate how well it performs on dataset CNN/Daily Mail
  * recurrent encoder and stacked Transformer decoder.  The obtained ROUGE
