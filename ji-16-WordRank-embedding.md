WordRank: Learning Word Embeddings via Robust Ranking
(Submitted on 9 Jun 2015 (v1), last revised 27 Sep 2016 (this version, v4))

# Abstract

* we argue that word embedding can be naturally viewed as a ranking problem due
* performance of WordRank is measured in word similarity and word analogy
  * very competitive to the state-of-the- arts on large corpora, while
    outperforms them by a significant margin when the training set is limited
  * With 17 million tokens, WordRank performs almost as well as existing
    methods using 7.2 billion tokens on a popular word similarity benchmark.
    Our multi-node distributed implementation of WordRank is publicly available
