# Abstract

* aspect-based sentiment analysis, which deals with 
  extracting, clustering, and rating the overall opinion about the features of
* Techniques for aspect extraction can produce to many aspects — with 
  * many of those relating to the same product feature. Hence, 
* aspect clustering becomes necessary. Current solutions for aspect clustering
  are monolingual, but in many practical situations, reviews for a given entity
* we address the novel task of multilingual aspect clustering, which aims at
  * Our method is unsupervised and 
    relies on the contextual information of the aspects, which is represented by
    word embeddings. This representation allied with a suitable similarity
* experiments on two datasets with five languages each showed that our
  * outperform monolingual baselines adapted to work with multilingual data
  * benefits of the multilingual approach compared to using languages in isolatn
