# Introduction

* semantically identifiable classes, which are the basis for generalizations
  * Fillmore (1970) points out that in terms of their linguistic behavior,
  * break and hit are each representative of a larger set of verbs
    * break involve a change of state in an entity
      * bend, fold, shatter, crack
    * hit involve contact, often forceful, with an entity,
      without entailing any change of state in that entity
      (e.g., The rocks hit the window, but luckily it wasn’t damaged)
      * slap, strike, bump, stroke (Fillmore 1970)
* All verbs in the break class – and none in the hit class –
  * show the two argument realization options in (1) and (2), which together
  * The window broke
  * the causative alternation (aka, “anticausative” or “causative/inchoative”)
  * the transitive use of a verb V means roughly ‘cause to V-intransitive’;
    * see B. Levin (1993) for discussion and references. More generally, both
      the break verbs and the hit verbs show a range of characteristic argument
      realization possibilities, going well beyond those just illustrated
* As Fillmore (1970) discusses
  * The window was broken allows both eventive and stative readings, while the
  * The window was hit allows only a stative reading
  * I broke/hit his leg.  I broke/`*`hit him on the leg
    * alternate expressions of the possessor of a body part
*  Fillmore (1977a): the sentences in the pair in (5)/(6) are not/are paraphras
  * (5) a. Perry broke/hit the fence with the stick
        b. Perry broke/hit the stick against the fence
* classes of verbs with similar meanings show characteristic arg real patterns
  * these patterns can be attributed to the semantic properties of each class
  * [corresponding] classes of verbs can be identified in other languages
    * Lhasa Tibetan (DeLancey 1995), Berber, Warlpiri, and
      Winnebago (Guerssel+ 1985)
* One goal: relevant components of meaning and the explication of
  their connection to the range of argument realization options
  * within generative grammar
    Carter (1976, 1977, 1988 [1976]), Fillmore (1968, 1971b), and Ostler (1979)
  * general theories of argument realization have been developed (Ackerman& 01+)
* “argument realization”: all facets of the syntactic expression of arguments
  * grammatical relation they may bear,
  * syntactic category, and
  * surface morphosyntactic expression
* The term “linking” has also been used in this connection
  * originated in Richard Carter’s unpublished 1976 paper, “Some Linking
    Regularities” (eventually published in 1988)
  * has other uses in other areas of linguistics, we adopt the term “argument r"
* five major questions:
  1. Which facets of the meanings of verbs are relevant for the mapping
    from lexical semantics to syntax?
  1. lexical semantic representation
    * primitives and the principles for combining these
  1. the algorithm which derives the syntactic expression of arguments
  1. non-semantic factors such as
    * information structure and heaviness
  1. To what extent are the semantic determinants lexical?
* many current theories of grammar assume that the syntactic realization of argu
  is predictable to a large extent from the meaning of the verbs
* This book
  * provide a bridge between the line of syntactic research that
    * presupposes a tight connection between verb meaning and syntax and
    * lexical semantic research into verb meanings
  * comparing different theories which address them
* the wide range of theoretical perspectives hinders the pooling of
  important insights
* most of the determinants of argument realization are not strictly lexical
  (Borer 1994+ Erteschik-Shir and Rapoport 1996; Ghomeshi and Massam 1995;
  Goldberg 1995; Hoekstra 1992; Jackendoff 1997; Kay 2000;
  Ritter and ST Rosen 1996, 1998)
  * syntactic configurations are themselves the bearers and determiners of
    certain meaning components; see section 7.1 for discussion

# 1 Challenges for theories of argument realization

* the nature of a lexical semantic representation of verb meaning

## 1.1 Taking lexical semantic representations seriously 7

* the syntactic realization of arguments is largely predictable from the meaning
  of their verbs
  * their category type and their grammatical function
  * many facets of the syntactic structure of a sentence to be projections of
    the lexical properties of its predicator
  * requiring that the arguments are appropriately represented in the syntactic
    representation of its clause.  Such principles include the
    * Principles and Parameters framework’s Projection Principle (Chomsky 1981)
    * LFG’s Completeness and Coherence Conditions
      (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), and
    * Role and Reference Grammar’s (RRG’s) Completeness Constraint
      (Foley and Van Valin 1984; Van Valin 1993b; Van Valin and LaPolla 1997)
* depends on the existence of both an articulated theory of
  * the lexical semantic representation of verbs and a theory of
  * the mapping between this representation and the relevant syntactic repr
* Syntacticians often appeal to principles which presuppose a lexical sem repr
  without seriously considering
  * the nature of the lexical semantic reprs on which they are meant to operate
  * the full range of empirical generalizations concerning argument realizations
    which these representations are meant to help account for
* We illustrate these shortcomings through a review of some relevant
  * claims that a lexical entry needs to register
    * s(emantic)-selection, the semantic selectional properties of verbs, and
    * not c(onstituent)-selection, the morphosyntactic properties of the
      arguments of verbs (Chomsky 1986; Pesetsky 1982; Stowell 1981)
  * Implicit assumption that
    s-selection takes a list of arguments, identified by their semantic roles
  * Chomsky (1986) e.g. suggests that the syntactic type and grammatical
    relation of each argument (c-selection) can be derived from s-selection
    * subcategorization frames can be dispensed with altogether
    * the fact that this verb is transitive, taking an NP subject and an NP DO
      follows from the fact that the verb selects two “things” as arguments
      (rather than e.g. a “thing” and a “proposition”)
    * The fact that the NP denoting the hitter is the subject and the NP
      denoting the contacted object is the direct object follows from
      * the former as agent and the latter as patient
      * universally agents and patients are realized as subjects and DOs
* lexical entries with agent and patient have been attributed to break and hit
  * A similar entry is also proposed for eat (Pesetsky 1995) and even for _see_
    (Rothstein 1983)
  * hE break, hit, eat, and _see_ turn out to diverge in systematic & fund ways
  * As already shown, hit differs from break in English
  * although verbs like break are consistently transitive across languages,
    verbs like hit are not, but rather in some languages they are
    intransitives with an oblique complement; see section 1.6
  * eat, like hit: ∗The cookie ate, OK The boy ate, unlike break and other
  * eat and other verbs of consumption show some unique properties in other
    languages
    * eg causativize differently from other transitive verbs in
      * Amharic (Amberber 2002a, 2002b)
      * Berber (Alalou and Farrell 1993; Guerssel 1986)
      * Kannada (Fried 1992)
      * Tariana (Aikhenvald 2000)
      * various Indo-Aryan languages (Alsina and Joshi 1991; Masica 1976;
        Ramchand 1997)
  * see/eat without an object receives a definite/indef interpr (Fillmore 1986)
* what is involved in formulating a lexical semantic representation
  * for the application of certain principles often invoked by syntacticians
  * Baker’s (1988) Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis:
    NPs bearing identical semantic roles to a verb have to be realized in the
    same syntactic relation to that verb
    * when two NPs bear the same semantic relation to a verb?
    * e.g. in the analysis of the dative alternation, exemplified by
    * _Terry gave a watch to Sam/Terry gave Sam a watch_
    * whether the two VP-internal arguments bear the same semantic roles in both
    * Most of the recent well-articulated theories of argument realization take
      semantic roles to be convenient labels for referring to arguments,
      derived from more basic components of lexical semantic representations
    * hE, complicated issues involved in determining a comprehensive analysis of
      particular roles

## 1.2 Identifying grammatically relevant facets of meaning 9

* complex and multifaceted nature of word meaning
  (Aitchison 1994; Bolinger 1965; Ullmann 1962), it is no small task to
  * provide words with a structured lexical semantic representation
* Two methodological choices have facilitated this task regarding
  * the nature of the evidence used to posit a lexical semantic representation
  * the types of semantic elements relevant to the lexical semantic repr
* evidence
  * purely linguistic vs acquisition, cognitive, and philosophical consider-
  * our focus is on the mapping from lexical semantics to syntax, we follow
    Dowty (1991) and take as
  * our primary criterion for developing a lexical semantic representation the
    ability to formulate a perspicuous [clearl] theory of argument realization
  * no certainty that the lexical semantic elements relevant to argument
    realization are also relevant to other linguistic or nonlinguistic concerns
  * B. Levin and Pinker (1991) note, there is considerable convergence in the
    facets of meaning that various types of evidence home in on, so that the use
* the remainder of this section: choosing the elements of a lexical sem repr
  * commonly assumed that only certain facets of word meaning are relevant to
    (Davis 2001; Grimshaw 1993; Jackendoff 1990b; B. Levin 1999; Pinker 1989; T
    Mohanan and K. P. Mohanan 1999; Rappaport Hovav and B. Levin 1998a)
  * Pinker: the set verb meanings are organized around is "much smaller than the
    set of cognitively available and culturally salient distinctions (1989
  * relevant components of verb meaning are usually isolated through an
    examination of the common semantic denominator of verbs exhibiting the same
    range of argument realization options
* color (Grimshaw 1993)
  * cognitively salient, but there are no grammatical processes or generalizs
    about the morphosyntactic realization of arguments which are restricted to
    verbs having to do with color (e.g., paint, color, bleach, redden, stain)
* Pesetsky (1995)
  * verbs of loud vssoft speech (e.g., bellow, holler, shout) vs (e.g., murmur,
    whisper) is not relevant
  * verbs of manner vscontent of speaking
    * e.g. holler and whisper vs say and propose, is grammatically relevant
    * his examples for grammatical properties of these classes of verbs involve
      sentential complements, which we do not discuss in this book, but instead
  * we present comparable examples involving verbs of sound emission, drawing on
    * English verbs of emission can be subdivided according to the emitted
      * light, sound, smell, or substance (B. Levin 1993)
    * Verbs of sound emission display a wide range of arg realization options,
      some of which are apparently restricted to a subset of these verbs. All
    * clatter and rattle, allow transitive, causative uses with (zörget)
      the emitter as object and
      an entity or natural force that causes the sound emission as subject
* Consistent with what Pesetsky (1995) notes in his discussion of verbs of
  * the volume, pitch, resonance, and duration of the sound play no part
  * critical is the mode of sound production. Some sounds are produced
    * internal to the sound emitter (e.g., babble, gurgle, holler, rumble),
    * external to it (e.g., clatter, jingle, rattle).  Still others may be
    * in either way, depending on the emitter (buzz, squeak, squeal, whistle);
      * e.g. a baby squeals vs as when tires squeal. The verbs of sound with
  * causative uses are associated with externally produced sounds
    (B. Levin, Song and Atkins 1996; Song 1996)
* B. Levin, Song, and Atkins (1997) argue, however, that
  * it is not mode of sound production which determines a verb’s behavior, but
  * whether the verb lexicalizes an internally vs ext caused event
  * An externally caused event is conceptualized as brought about by an external
    cause with immediate control over the event. The core verbs lexicalizing
    * change-of-state verbs, such as break, open, or cool, which describe an
    * always have transitive uses, as in The wind opened the door, but they
    * often have intransitive uses which do not make the external cause explicit
  * internally caused event is conceptualized as arising from inherent propertis
    * inherent properties are “responsible” for the event; no external force is
    * prototypical: sing and dance, have an agentive argument with a
      self-controlled body acting volitionally
    * Less prototypical
      * actions which arise from within the entity denoted by their argument or
        * shiver and yawn, while usually not volitional, can only arise from
      * from some property inherent to it.  For example, the events associated
        * instances of light emission, such as shining and glistening, require
          that their emitters have certain properties so that they may shine or
    * involve only one argument and this argument cannot be externally
      controlled, verbs denoting such events are intransitive, no cau alter
* Returning to the verbs of sound emission, B. Levin, Song, and Atkins (1997)
  * that mode of sound production correlates with externally vs internally causd
  * sounds produced internal/ext to the sound emitter,
    * such as groan and holler, vs jingle and rattle
    are conceived of as internally/ext caused
  * sounds that can be produced either internally or externally, according to
    the choice of emitter, are open to either an internally or an externally
    caused classification, depending on the mode of sound production
* This result is welcome since
  the distinction between an internally and an externally caused event
  cuts across a larger swath of the lexicon than a distinction based on prod mod
* verbs of bodily process with respect to auxiliary selection in Italian
  (C Rosen 1981; B Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995)
  * In Italian some intransitive verbs are found with the auxiliary essere ‘be’
    and others with the auxiliary avere ‘have.’ This nonuniform behavior
  * has been understood in the context of Perlmutter’s (1978) Unaccusative Hypot
    * two subclasses of intransitive verbs:
      * be: unaccusative verbs, whose surface subject is an underlying object, and
        have: unergative verbs, whose surface subject is an underlying subject; see
        (Burzio 1986; Perlmutter 1978, 1989; C. Rosen 1981)
    * semantically determined (Perlmutter 1978; Perlmutter and Postal 1984), so
* The first accounts of the classification of verbs as unaccusative or unerg
  (Perlmutter 1978) made reference to specific semantic classes of verbs. Verbs
  * Vs of bodily process, such as cough, snore, and yawn, were unerg
    * take the auxiliary avere ‘have’ in Italian, with
    * one exception: the Italian verb arrossire [elpirul] takes _essere_ ‘be.’
  * C. Rosen (1984), some members of this semantic class in other languages also
    could be considered unaccusative. Such examples have led
    * argue that unaccusativity is not fully semantically determined after all
* McClure (1990)
  * notion “verb of bodily process” is not appropriate for generalizations
  * activity verbs take avere ‘have’ 6 and
  * achievement verbs – which are largely change-of-state verbs – take essere
  * most verbs of bodily process are activity verbs, it might appear that this
  * _arrossire_ is the exception that proves that the right rule is change of st
    * based on the adjective rosso ‘red,’ literally means ‘become red’; thus, it
    * a change-of-state verb and takes the appropriate auxiliary, essere ‘be.’
* concepts with greater generality such as “change of state” or “activity” are
  preferable in principle to more specific concepts such as “V of bodily proc”
  * certain verbs can receive multiple characterizations even in terms of
    general semantic notions because of overlaps and interdependencies between
  * necessary to look for verbs that satisfy only one semantic characterization
    in order to identify which one matters to a given phenomenon.  This point
* illustrated with the notions “agentivity” and “stativity.”
  * Many of the stativity tests identified by Lakoff (1966) turn out to be
    agentivity tests, but this mischaracterization
    only becomes apparent when it is shown that nonagentive nonstatives also
    fail the tests (Lakoff 1966; Lee 1971; B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995;
    also see section 4.2.1). Thus, based on contrasts such as
  * _My mother persuaded me to `*`know/OK learn French_
  * Lakoff argues that only nonstatives can be complements of persuade;
  * hE, `∗`_My mother persuaded the telephone to ring_ shows that
  * the real issue is agentivity
* For discussion and exemplification of potential pitfalls in identifying
  semantic determinants of argument realization and methodological strategies
  for avoiding them, see the literature on unaccusativity, including B. Levin
  and Rappaport Hovav (1989, 1995), L. Levin (1986), and McClure (1990)
* verbs of psychological state or psych-verbs, as they are often referred to
  * Psych-verbs have a variety of distinctive properties
    (See B. Levin 1993 for references on English psych-verbs and
    section 1.5 for discussion of psych-verbs across languages.) One striking
  * English psych-verb minimal pairs such as fear and frighten or like vs please
  * in sentences that are near-paraphrases, as illustrated in (5) and (6),
  * the experiencer is expressed as subject and in the (b) sentences as object
  * In English this phenomenon is rarely observed outside the class of psych-verbs
  * early discussions of semantic roles cite minimal pairs as in (5) and (6) to
    * semantic roles themselves are not sufficient for determining the synt
    * taken to indicate that the subject of fear and the object of frighten bear
      the same semantic role and that the object of fear and the subject of
  * Belletti and Rizzi (1988) and Grimshaw (1990), experiencer and theme
    * The assignment of an experiencer role reflects the verbs's meaning
    * unclear what motivates the assignment of the theme role to their second
    * “Theme” is usually defined as the role of an entity whose movement,
      location, state, or change of state is specified by
    * a general tendency to treat theme as a default role; see section 2.4. The
  * very similar, if not identical, underlying syntactic representations
    (Belletti and Rizzi 1988; Postal 1971)
  * these analyses are extended to other psych-verbs since fear and like, on the
    fear.  adore, detest, and esteem, while
    frighten. astonish, disturb, and shock are among the approximately two hundred
  * problems with parallel underlying syntactic analyses for fear and frighten
    psych-verbs (Arad 1998, 1999, 2002; Bouchard 1995; Croft 1993; Grimshaw 90+)
  * semantic differences between verbs like fear and verbs like frighten (Allen +)
  * Grimshaw (1990). frighten as causative and fear as stative. Therefore, the
    * subject of frighten is a cause, while the subject of fear is not
    * Although all fear verbs are stative,
      some frighten verbs,
      such as concern, are also stative, and others,
      such as bother, can be stative or nonstative; therefore
    * stativity is not relevant.  Rather,
    * the notion of cause is probably implicated in the difference between the two
  * Pesetsky (1995) points out that
    the non-experiencer argument of fear verbs must denote the actual stimulus
    * not true of the nonexperiencer argument of the frighten verbs. If
    * _Terry fears war_, it is the contemplation of war itself which evokes fear
      _a newspaper article frightens Terry_, the fear may be of something
      discussed or reported in the article, such as the possibility of war
    * association between a cause and a result is typical of causative verbs
      (B.  Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995; Vendler 1984)
    * frighten verbs are causative – whether or not they are stative – and their
      nonexperiencer argument is analyzed as some kind of cause. In contrast,
    * fear verbs are noncausative; the semantic role of their nonexperiencer
      * “stimulus” suggested by Talmy (1985) is often used, and the role
      * “target” and “subject matter” introduced by Pesetsky (1987, 1995) have
      * can be evaluated only in the context of a full theory of argument real
        * not tailored to psych-verbs alone
    * sufficient in certain theories to account for the difference in mapping
      (Dowty 1991; Pesetsky 1995); see section 3.1.1 for discussion
  * We return to psych-verbs in section 1.5, reconsidering them in a crossling

## 1.3 The cross-classification of verbs and the status of verb classes 16

* it is the elements of meaning that define verb classes that are most
  * verb classes themselves are epiphenomenal – also stressed by ST Rosen (1996)
* require isolating those semantic components which ultimately
* further examining the two classes of verbs of communication mentioned in 1.2 –
  * verbs of manner vs content of speaking
  * both types of verbs can express the addressee in a PP headed by _to_ and
  * both can take an indirect speech complement, as in (7), verbs of
    _Evelyn screamed/said (to Marilyn) to go_
  * manner of speaking allow
    * the addressee to be expressed in am _at_ PP
      (8) a. Evelyn screamed/`*`said at Marilyn
    * the content to be expressed in a PP headed by about, but content not
      (9) a. Claudia screamed/`*`said about the new management
* hE, the relevant feature not verbs of manner vs content of speaking or verbs
  * Mufwene (1978) demonstrates that the many distinctive
  * properties of verbs of manner are also manifested by verbs of other semantic
    * chat, complain, speak, and talk, like manner-of-speaking verbs,
    * allow _about_ phrases, as illustrated in (10).  (10)
      _Claudia complained/spoke/talked about the new management_
  * further investigation is needed to identify the conjunction of semantic
    properties that is the source of the constellation of behavioral properties
    that first led Zwicky to identify a class of manner-of-speaking verbs.)
* several subclasses of verbs of putting. Many verbs, including these, have
  * more than one argument realization option and may show
  * one or more alternations in the expression of the same set of arguments,
  * one or more argument (or diathesis) alternations, such as the causative
  * spray and smear, exhibit what is now known as the locative alternation – an
    * not only in English, but in a range of other languages (B. Levin 1993;
      Baker 1997, Basilico 1998, Brinkmann 1997, Dimitrova-Vulchanova 1998,
      Laffut 1997, 1998, 1999, Stroik 1996)
  * DO =
    * transferred stuff
      * characteristic of verbs like put and pour
    * surface
      * cover and fill; however
  * neither verbs like put or pour, nor verbs like cover or fill show both opts
  * even locative alternation verbs do not share all options for argument
    * splash [loccsan(t)] but not smear [ken] shows the transitive and
      intransitive uses characteristic of the causative alternation
      (Hale and Keyser 1993, 1997b, 1999; Kiparsky 1997)
    * (14) a. The pigs splashed/smeared mud on the wall
           b. Mud splashed/`*`smeared on the wall. (Hale and Keyser 1993))
* As discussed in section 1.2, causative alternation is shown
  * predominantly by verbs of change of state, but it is
  * also by certain verbs which, like splash, involve a change of location
    (e.g., move, roll, spin) (Smith 1970)
  * most verbs found in the causative alternation do not show the locative alte,
* Precisely delineating the class of verbs showing a particular alternation
  presents a real challenge, which we take up in chapter 7
* verb classes are similar in status to natural classes of sounds in phonology,
  * the elements of meaning ~ distinctive features
* these grammatically relevant facets of meaning are viewed as constituting the
  interface between a full-fledged representation of meaning and the syntax,
  * universal and relatively small in size
    * most researchers have assumed that, like the set of distinctive features,
  * hE, feature notations may not be the appropriate means for representing
    semantic elements (see section 2.2.1)
* variations in meaning that often accompany argument alternations. These
  * often illustrated with the locative alternation. As discussed in numerous
  * not truth-conditionally equivalent:
  * scenario in which a significant part of the wagon is still empty, but the
  * alternations \subset multiple argument realization – the ability of most
    verbs to appear in a variety of syntactic contexts. The variation in meaning
  * led many researchers to conclude that the projectionist approach is misguide
    * i.e. the program of deriving the syntactic contexts's of V directly from
      its meaning
    * constructional approach, where meaning resides in the syntactic context
    * We discuss these two approaches more extensively in chapter 7. Here we
    * both approaches agree to a large extent on what the elements of meaning
      are – be they lexical or extralexical – which determine the realization of
      arguments
      * the identification of these elements of meaning needed by both

## 1.4 Verb meanings represent construals of events 19

* rather than the events themselves
  * relatedly, Krifka [1998] stresses that
    telicity is a property of event descriptions, not of events themselves.)
* individuation (Clark 1978; Croft 1991; Gentner 1981, 1982)
  * most physical objects perceptually ;
  * Happenings in the world via language
  * Verbs lexicalize properties of happenings in the world; we use the term
  * event = happenings whose properties are lexicalized by verbs
  * Verbs, then, are predicates of events (Parsons 1990) and
  * phrases containing verbs can be considered “event descriptions.” Since a
  * different verbs lexicalize different subsets of these properties, may be
  * As discussed in section 1.2, in the English–Italian pair blush/arrossire,
    * a process in English, but as a change of state in Italian, so that the
* Many purported counterexamples to the projectionist claim fail to recog this
  * what DeLancey (1991) terms “the objectivist error.” This error involves
    * incorporate into the semantic representation of the clause inferences
      which are not in fact part of the event representation of the clause
  * e.g. John threw the ball through the window
    * window vs ball as the entity that changed
    * they imagined a scenario with a closed window. The objectivist error
    * an “imagined ‘real world’” (1991), rather than on the linguistic
* objectivist error can underlie conclusions that certain pairs of verbs that
  can name the same event arbitrarily represent distinct “lexicalizations.”
  * Psych-verb doublets such as fear and frighten have been taken to represent
    * different construals of the same happening as events
    * fear represents a psychological state holding of the experiencer and
      frighten represents the bringing about of a psychological state in the
  * buy and sell, which can describe the same commercial transaction
    * Dixon (1979; Fillmore (1977b) describe sell/buy as presenting a particular
      event from the perspective of the seller/buyer
      * different “viewpoints” on the same transaction and assume that there is
      * no truth-conditional difference in the descriptions of a commerc transac
    * Van Valin (1999) suggesting that buy and sell may differ in truth cond;
      * in various languages the verb  meaning sell _(verkaufen)_ is
        morphologically derived from the verb meaning buy _(kaufen)_ , often via
        a causative morpheme, e.g., German
        * Lakhota ophéthu̧ ‘buy’/iyópheya ‘sell,’ and
        * Tagalog bili ‘buy’/mag-bili ‘sell,’ but the verb meaning
      * buy is never the causative of the verb meaning sell, surely no accident
      * there are certain happenings which can be described using one verb, but
        not the other, as the following pair exemplifies:
        _The vending machine in the hall sold Chris a pack of cigarettes_
      * buying is in some sense more basic than selling and that
        buy’s meaning is perhaps properly contained in sell’s. If
      * sell is causative, while buy is not, then it is not an accident that the
        seller is realized as sell’s subject
      * As we discuss in section 4.1.2.2,
      * arguments analyzed as causes are subjects
        regardless of the semantic properties of other arguments

## 1.5 Uniformity and variation in argument realization 20

* Verbs in some/other classes tend to show variation
  in both/neither argument realization and across languages
* These patterns of variation and uniformity form another testbed for the isola-
  tion of grammatically relevant aspects of meaning
  * If the appropriate elements of meaning are chosen,
    verbs whose classification is clearcut with respect to these elements
    should have stable argument realization patterns, while those whose
* typological studies (Andrews 1985; Croft 1990; DeLancey 1984; Dixon 1979,
  1994; Hopper and Thompson 1980; B. Levin 1999; Nichols 1975; Tsunoda 1985),
  * animate agent acts on and causes a change in a patient,
    * crush, destroy, or kill, are
    * transitive in all languages, with the agent being expressed as the subject
      and the patient as the direct object (though see note 4). Both within and
  * two-argument verbs which do not fit this mold exhibit
    * crossl (Blume 1998; Dezsö 1982; Nichols 1975; Testelec 1998; Tsunoda 1985)
    * less uniformity within a given language (B.  Levin 1999)
    * e.g. many verbs of authority, ruling, and disposition,
      * in Russian, take instrumental complements, though their
      * English counterparts are transitive
        (Dezsö 1982; Fowler 1996; Nichols 1975, 1984; Wierzbicka 1980)
      * Even within English, such verbs do not show uniformity in argument real
        * transitive (e.g., command, direct, govern, manage), others are
        * intransitive + over (e.g., preside, reign), and
        * both (rule and tyrannize)
* hit and other surface-contact verbs, including kick, kiss, and slap. These
  * English transitive verbs, in other languages not necessarily simple transit
  * Lhasa Tibetan
    * break, cut, and kill are obligatorily transitive, the counterpart of
    * hit is not;
    * the argument denoting the surface contacted obligatorily takes a locative
      tree-LOC axe-ERG hit
  * surface-contact verbs are expressed in Tibetan using verb–noun combinations
    * I throw Lobsang a kick
  * Ingush also uses verb–noun combinations to express certain surface-contact
    * noun tuop ‘rifle’ in combination with the verb tuoxan ‘hit’ means ‘shoot’
      and not ‘beat with a rifle’ (Nichols 1984)
    * Again, as in Tibetan, the surface contacted is expressed in an oblique
      * pattern which according to Nichols (1984) is common across Caucasian
        languages
* individual members of varying classes to show a range of argument realiz ops
  * e.g. English either the surface or the instrument as their object, as in
    (19) a. Lindsay hit/beat the stick against the fence
                             the fence with a stick
    * analogue of the most common Caucasian argument realization pattern for
      surface-contact verbs
* psych-verbs, which display striking crosslinguistic variability in arg real op
  * Vs like frighten do not show much crosslinguistic variation: they are
    consistently experiencer–object verbs (Croft 1993). This consistency is
    * not surprising since these verbs describe the causation of a psychological
      state in the experiencer; often even take animate, agentive subjects,
    * but their object is animate rather than inanimate
  * Italian frighten verbs, for example, are transitive verbs just like English
  * much crosslinguistic variation in the counterparts of the fear verbs, that
    * inherently noncausative (see section 1.2)
    * Italian, for instance, has verbs which are semantically fear verbs and
      which express their arguments precisely as the English fear verbs do
      ‘Gianni fears this.’
    * In many languages, however, these verbs show a pattern that is
      * the experiencer is in the dative and the stimulus in the nom (or abs)
      * tetszik
      * rarely available in English (appeals to me; see B. Levin (1993)
      * languages showing this pattern differ as to how so-called subject
        properties are distributed over the experiencer and stimulus arguments
        * in Kannada/Hebrew it is the dative/nom NP that is replaced by PRO in a
          control structure Hermon (1986), while in
* Croft (1993), there is variation within and across languages in the expression
  of the arguments of noncausative, but not causative, psych-verbs
  * According to him, the reason is that the
    causative psych-verbs unambiguously fit the semantic mold of core transitive
  * the noncausative psych-verbs can be “coerced” into either of two semantic
  * We return to this question in chapter
    * 2, where the implications of the patterns of argument realization of
      psych-verbs for the nature of semantic roles is discussed, in chapter
    * 4, where we suggest that argument realization considerations can help
      choose between different theories of the semantic determinants of arg real
    * 7, which is devoted to multiple argument realization
      associated with certain verbs

## 1.6 When subjects are not agents and objects are not patients 24

* agent–patient verbs constitute a significant part of the class of transitive
  * so uniform in their argument realization,
  * many theories of argument realization make direct reference to the semantic
    roles agent and patient – or its relative theme (see section 2.4) – and have
  * misleading for two reasons
    * “agent” and “patient” are not the only semantic notions associated with SO
    * subject and object often have multiple morphosyntactic realizations, and a
      * deviations from the agent and patient prototypes are
        sometimes, but not always, associated with
        deviations from the prototypical morphosyntactic realizations of S and O
* Although agents of two-argument verbs are always subjects,
  * some languages also allow a range of nonagents as subjects. These include
    * nonagentive causes, experiencers, and emitters (Fillmore 1968; Hawkins
      1985; B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995; Schlesinger 1995), as we
  (24) storm destroyed the crop
       bulldozer flattened the hovels
       child hated the spinach
       old machine spews smoke
* location and measure subjects, though
  * Hawkins (1985), citing Rohdenburg (1974), and Perlmutter and Postal (1984)
  * the natural Hebrew translations of these sentences do not maintain the same
    subjects
  (26) a. This room sleeps five people
       b. This edition of the text book had added a new chapter
       c. A dollar won’t buy a cup of coffee any more
  * the preverbal NPs in the sentences in (26) are subjects by virtue of
    determining verbal agreement, these sentences do
    not have corresponding verbal passives.) Furthermore, these
* languages to differ as to what nonagent arguments may be subjects
  (DeLancey 1985; Dixon 1979; Guilfoyle 1995, 2000; Hawkins 1981, 1982, 1985,
  1995; van Voorst 1996). Across languages, these nonagent arguments
  * those that are semantically “close” to agents, including
    natural forces, experiencers, instruments, and even emitters, as in (24)
  * many fewer languages allowing the types of subjects that are further (26)
  * Irish (Guilfoyle 1995, 2000) and Jacaltec (Craig 1976), do not allow even
    the semantically “closer” arguments to be subjects. In fact, many languages
* In English the nonpatient arguments that are not prototypical agents need not
  be expressed as subjects; for example, they may be obliques, as in (27)–(30),
  an alternative usually not open to true agent arguments, as shown in (31) and
  b. His uncle died from/of pneumonia
  b. The chocolate melted in the sun
  b. Smoke spews from that old machine.26
  b. Five people can sleep in this room
  b. ∗ Caesar died from/of Brutus
  b. ∗ The chocolate melted in/from me
* the factors that determine subjecthood are quite different from those that
  determine expression as an oblique; the latter involve much finer-grained sem
* Two additional challenge for the algorithm determining the subject. First,
  * patients which are expressible as direct objects of transitive verbs can
    sometimes be expressed as subjects of
    * the intransitive uses of the same V (open, crack)
    * semantically related intransitive verbs (fell/fall, kill/die)
  * languages often have one or more morphosyntactic processes which create
    subjects from objects, with passive being the most widely cited
* The analysis of patient subjects depends on the basic assumptions adopted
  concerning the nature of the mapping between lexical semantics and syntax
  * A theory that adopts Baker’s (1988) Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypoth-
    * maps the patient argument to direct object in passive as well as active
      * its realization as subject in passive sentences is accomplished by a
        syntactic “promotion” – most often, movement. Such analyses are
    * typical of multistratal theories of syntax, including
      Principles and Parameters and its descendants and Relational Grammar
  * Monostratal theories deal with such phenomena in other ways. They may impose
    * a more sophisticated organization over the semantic roles themselves, as
      in Role and Reference Grammar (Foley and Van Valin 1984; Van Valin and
      LaPolla 1997), or they may introduce
    * another level of analysis which is not necessarily syntactic in nature, as
      in LFG’s Lexical Mapping Theory (Bresnan 2001;
      Bresnan and Kanerva 1989). The ways in which theories deal with these
      * briefly discussed in section 5.1; see also Sadler and Spencer (1998)
* implications for the design of a lexical semantic representation. Data such as
  * Fillmore (1970), break to represent a verb which selects an agent argument;
  * break is not necessarily agentive, even when it takes an animate subject, as
    * DeLancey (1984), Van Valin and D. Wilkins (1996), and even Fillmore (1970)
  * (38) The boy broke the window (accidentally).  (Van Valin and Wilkins 1996)
  * kill, another verb commonly taken to be agentive, does not require an agent
    * contrasting with the verb murder, which does require one.  (39) a
    * intentionally/accidentally
    * verbs which _require_ agents as subjects such as murder are much rarer
* patient
  * The same issues arise with the notion of agent/pat and the semantic under-
    pinnings of subjecthood/DO
  * All languages realize patients as objects, but
    * and themes, if these are distinguished from patients
    * some languages allow various types of nonpatients as objects as well
    * English is particularly liberal in this regard, as the following examples
      * The engineer ~ the bridge (B. Levin 1999, (1))
      cracked (patient)
      destroyed (patient/consumed object)
      painted (incremental theme; Dowty 1991)
      moved (theme)
      built (effected object/factitive; Fillmore 1968)
      washed (location/surface)
      hit (location; Fillmore 1970)
      crossed (path)
      reached (goal)
      left (source)
      saw (stimulus/object of perception)
      hated (stimulus/target or object of emotion)
* frighten psych-verbs have been characterized as taking experiencer objects
* The objects of transitive verbs of authority, ruling, and disposition in
  English
  * not fit neatly under any of the traditional semantic roles, though as noted
  * not necessarily transitive in all languages
* interaction verbs (Blume 1998) documents several languages in which what she
  * two animate arguments – take a subject and an oblique; these include
  * German, Hungarian, Maori, Rumanian, Samoan, and Tongan. Yet, these same
  * almost all transitive in English
  * English also permits various path, goal, and source arguments as objects, as
* obliques that are said to be “advanced” to object
  * just as there are objects said to be “advanced” to subject, so there are 
  * sentence pairs with the same verb have a particular argument expressed as an
  * expression as an object is accompanied by the affixation of an “applicative”
    morpheme on the verb. This phenomenon is particularly well represented
  * in Bantu languages and illustrated in (42) with an example from Chicheŵa;

    * As with passives, a theory adopting the Uniformity of Theta Assignment
      Hypot will have a rule “promoting” an oblique to object in applicative
    * otherwise, deals with the relation between these two in other ways
      * LFG’s Lexical Mapping Theory associates semantic roles with
        partially specified characterizations of argument realization options
        that give rise to one realization when a morphological rule operates, as
        in (42b), and another otherwise, as in (42a)
        (Alsina and Mchombo 1993; Bresnan and Moshi 1990)
