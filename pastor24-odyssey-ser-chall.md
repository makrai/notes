# Abstract

* we explore the efficacy of novel sequence modeling architectures, with a
  specific focus on Selective State Space Models (SSM), known as MAMBA, for the
* classification model employed for this task integrates an SSM, in conjunction
  with a FeedForward layer and a Self-Attention mechanism. SSMs have
* data augmentation techniques, including additive and convolutional noise as
  well as SpecAugment, are implemented to mitigate overfitting. The proposed
* F1 Macro score of 29.42% in the MSP-Podcast test dataset, a performance level
  akin to that of the baseline system established in the challenge
