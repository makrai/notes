# Abstract

* Starting from HyperLex, the only available GR-LE dataset in English, we
  * new monolingual GR-LE datasets for three other languages, and combine those
  * six cross-lingual GR-LE datasets termed CL-HYPERLEX.  We next present a
  * novel method dubbed CLEAR (Cross-Lingual Lexical Entailment Attract-Repel)
    * leverages taxonomic LE knowledge in a resource-rich language
    * cross-lingual LE transfer, CLEAR sets competitive baseline performance on
  * CLEAR outperforms current state-of-the-art on binary cross-lingual LE
    detection by a wide margin for diverse language pairs.
