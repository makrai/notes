Meaning in Language An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics

University of Manchester OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS

# Preface

* the reader will see with the undeniably messy 'real world' of meaning. At the
  * As far as semantic theories are concerned, I have been unashamedly eclectic
    * adopting whatever approach to a particular problem sheds light on it
  * theoretical bias in favour of approaches like cognitive linguistics
    * embrace the continuity and nonfiniteness of meaning
* The organization of the book is as follows
  * four parts
    1. basic notions that underlie virtually all sem
    2. aspects of the meanings of words;
    3. deals with semantic aspects of grammar;
    4. pragmatics: the core areas, and the relations between meaning & context
* Each chapter contains a set of discussion questions and/or exercises,
  * except Chapter I and Chapter 5
  * suggested answers to which will be found at the end of the book

Part I

# 1 a very general introduction to questions of meaning

* locating the linguistic study of meaning within the wider context of the
  study of signs and communication in general

# 2 fundamental conceptual tools, mostly from logic

* have a wide currency [széles körben használhatók] in discussions of sem
* indispensable background knowledge for a study of meaning in language

# 3 concepts for the description of meanings and differences of meaning

* Lyons (1977): descriptive and non-descriptive meaning and, under each of
  these headings, important types and dimensions of variation are described

# 4 the way(s) in which meanings are combined to form more complex meanings

Part 2

# 5 a general introduction to the study of word meanings

* whether there are any restrictions on what sort of meanings words can bear,
* distinguishing the meaning of
  * a word from that of a sentence or discourse, and the meanings of
  * full lexical items from the meanings of grammatical elements
* the major approaches to lexical semantics

## 5.1 The nature of word meaning
## 5.2 The major problems of lexical semantics
## 5.3 Approaches to lexical semantics
## Suggestions for further reading

# 6 variation in a single word form in different contexts

* from arbitrarily juxtaposed homonymies to subtle modulations of sense

# 7 a conceptual approach to lexical semantics

* whether and to what extent word meanings can be equated with concepts
* prototype theory
  * the currently dominant approach to natural conceptual categories, and
  * its relevance for the study of word meanings

# 8 and 9 paradigmatic sense relations

* Relations of sense between lexical items in same syntactic position
* ie hyponymy, meronymy, incompatibility, synonymy, antonymy, complementarity,
  reversivity, and converseness

# 10 word fields: larger groupings of words

* mainly structured by the sense relations examined in the previous two chaps

# 11 metaphor and metonymy, which enable new meanings to be produced

# 12 syntagmatic sense relations

* meaning relations between words in the same syntactic construction
* normal and abnormal collocations
* reasons for tendency for certain types of words to cooccur
* selectional pressures of words on their partners in a string

# 13 the componential approach to the description of word meaning

* specifies meaning in terms of semantic primitives

Part 3

# 14 the sorts of meanings associated with various grammatical entities

* whether there are any constant meanings attached to categories such as noun,
  verb, and adjective, and functions such as subject and object
* meaning borne by grammatical elements of various sorts, such as
  * number and gender in the noun phrase,
  * tense, aspect, and modality in connection with the verb,
  * degree in the adjective, and so on

Part 4 pragmatics, topics which are usually considered to fall under ~

* aspects of meaning which cannot be satisfactorily treated without context or
* not propositional in nature (or both)

# 15 reference

* establishing connections between utterances and the extralinguistic world
* as the assigning of values to variables, the
  * variables being signalled by definite expressions and the
  * values being items in the extralinguistic world
* Various strategies for indicating (speaker) and determining (hearer) the ref
* deictic elements, names, and descriptions

# 16 speech act theory, mainly following Austin and Searle (1969)

* the acts that people perform when they are speaking
* eg stating, requesting, warning, congratulating, commanding, and so on
* The range of different types of speech act and their nature

# 17 conversational implicatures

* those aspects of the intended meaning of an utterance which are
  not encoded in its linguistic structure, but are, 'read between the lines'
* types of conversational implicature
* explanations of how they arise

# 18 practical applications and open problems
