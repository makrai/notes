* We intro EasyCall, a new dysarthric speech command dataset in Italian, called
  * 21 K audio recordings from 24 healthy and 31 dysarthric speakers, whose
    individual degree of speech impairment was assessed by neurologists through
    the Therapy Outcome Measure.  The corpus aims at providing a resource for
    the development of ASR-based assistive technologies for patients with
    dysarthria. In particular, it may be exploited to develop a
    voice-controlled contact application for commercial smartphones, aiming at
    improving dysarthric patients' ability to communicate with their family and
    caregivers. Before recording the dataset, participants were administered a
    survey to evaluate which commands are more likely to be employed by
    dysarthric individuals in a voice-controlled contact application. In
    addition, the dataset includes a list of non-commands (i.e., words
    near/inside commands or phonetically close to commands) that can be
    leveraged to build a more robust command recognition system. At present
    commercial ASR systems perform poorly on the EasyCall Corpus as we report
    in this paper. This result corroborates the need for dysarthric speech
    corpora for developing effective assistive technologies. To the best of our
    knowledge, this database represents the richest corpus of dysarthric speech
    to date.
