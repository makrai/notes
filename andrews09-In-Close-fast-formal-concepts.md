# Abstract

* In-Close 
  * uses incremental closure and matrix searching to quickly compute all formal
    concepts in a formal context
  * based, conceptually, on a well known algorithm called Close-By-One.
* This paper compares In-Close to Krajca, 
  * Krajca (2008) was shown to be in the order of 100 times faster than several
    well-known algorithms [and] other algorithms in reviews suggest 
  * discussing computational methods, data requirements and memory
    * experiments using several public data sets and random data
  * In-Close is in the order of 20 times faster than Krajca
