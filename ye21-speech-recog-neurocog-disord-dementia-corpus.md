# Abstract

* Dementia-Bank Pitt corpus for automatic NCD detection.
* Speed perturbation based audio data augmentation expanded the limited elderly
* Large quantities of out-of-domain, non-aged adult speech were exploited by
  * 1000-hour LibriSpeech corpus trained LF-MMI factored TDNN system to
* i-Vector and learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) based speaker adaptive
* Robust Bayesian estimation of TDNN systems and LHUC transforms were used in
  both cross-domain and speaker adaptation
* A Transformer language model was also built to improve the final system
* word error rate (WER) reduction of 11.72% absolute (26.11% relative) was
* NCD detection accuracy of 88%
  * comparable to that using the ground truth speech transcripts, was obtained
  * textual features extracted from the final ASR system outputs
