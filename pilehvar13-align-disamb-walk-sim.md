    A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity
acl 2013

# Abstract

* approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels
  * all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents

# 1 Introduction

* The contributions of this paper are threefold.
* unified representation of ... an arbitrarily-sized piece of text,
* novel alignment-based method for
  * word sense disambiguation during semantic comparison
* state-of-the-art performance on three similarity tasks
  * SemEval-2012
  * word pair similarity
    * TOEFL
    * Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965
  * sense-coarsening

# 2 A Unified Semantic Representation

* 2.1 Semantic Signatures
  * random walks: nem lehetne expliciten?
* 2.2 Alignment-Based Disambiguation
  * leverages the content of the paired item
    in order to disambiguate each element
* 2.3 Semantic Signature Similarity

# 3 Experiment 1: Textual Similarity
