                               x = a' − a + b. 

* if `a*` and `a` are very similar to each other 
  * (as scream and screaming are likely to be) 
  * the nearest word to x may simply be the nearest neighbor of b.  If in a
    given set of analogies the nearest neighbor of b tends to be b* , then,
    the method may give the correct answer regardless of the consistency of
    the offsets (Figure 2).
* methods. 
  * First, we propose new baselines that perform the task without using the
   offset `a* − a` and argue that the performance of the offset method should be
   compared to those baselines. 
  * Second, we measure how the performance of the method is affected by
   reversing the direction of each analogy problem (Figure 3) 
    * reversal should not affect its accuracy.
