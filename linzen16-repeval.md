# 1 Introduction

                               x = a' − a + b

* if `a*` and `a` are very similar to each other
  * (as scream and screaming are likely to be)
  * the nearest word to x may simply be the nearest neighbor of b.
  * If in a given set of analogies the nearest neighbor of b tends to be `b*`,
    may be correct answer regardless of the consistency of the offsets
* our methods
  1. new baselines that perform the task without using the offset `a* − a` and
    * the performance of the offset method should be compared to those baselines
  2. measure how the performance is affected by reversing the direction of each
     analogy problem
    * reversal should not affect its accuracy
