# Abstract

* detection of pathologies affecting speech through automatic analysis
* Voice processing has indeed been used for evaluating several diseases such as
  Parkinson, Alzheimer, or depression
  * ? If some studies present results that seem sufficient for clinical
  * not the case for the detection of sleepiness. Even two international
    challenges and the recent advent of deep learning techniques have still not
    managed to change this situation. This article explores the hypothesis that
* we the observed average performances find their cause in corpus design
* organization
  * we refine the concept of sleepiness related to the ground-truth labels.
  * in-depth study of four corpora, bringing to light 
    * the methodological choices that have been made and 
    * the underlying biases they may have induced.  Finally, in light of this
  * we propose guidelines for the design of new corpora.

    medical validation, machine learning ﬁtting and goal ﬁtting. 
    * KSS: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale
    * ESS: Epworth Sleepiness Scale
    * MSLT: Multiple Sleep Latency Test
    * MWT: Maintenance of Wakefulness Test.
