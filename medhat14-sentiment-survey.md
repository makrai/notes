Sentiment analysis algorithms and applications: A survey
2014 Ain Shams Engineering Journal

# 1. Introduction

* Sentiment Analysis (SA) or Opinion Mining (OM) is the computational study of
  people’s opinions, attitudes and emotions toward an entity
  * target can represent individuals, events or topics
  * The two expressions SA or OM are interchangeable
* three main classification levels in SA:
  document-level, sentence-level, and aspect-level SA
  * Document-level SA positive or negative opinion or sentiment
  * on Sentence-level, the first step is to identify whether the sentence
    is subjective or objective
    * sentences are just short documents [3]
  * This survey tackles the first two kinds of SA
* data sets
  * product reviews, stock markets [4,5], news articles [6],
    political debates [7]
* applications and enhancements on SA algorithms from the last few years
* papers categorized according to
  * target of the article[,?] algorithms[,?] and data used in their work
  * discussed the Feature Selection (FS) techniques in details along with their
  * Sentiment Classification (SC) techniques, as shown in Fig. 2
* related fields in SA which have attracted the researchers lately
  * Emotion Detection (ED), emotions could be explicit or implicit
  * Building Resources (BR) and
    * lexica, corpora annotated and sometimes dictionaries
  * Transfer Learning (TL) or Cross-Domain classification
* surveys from the applications point of view
  not from the SA techniques point of view [1,3,8–11]
* contribution of this survey
  * categorization of recent articles by techniques
  * panoramic view on algorithms and their originating references
  * benchmarks data sets discussed and categorized by applications
  * related fields

# 2 survey methodology and a summary of the articles

# 3 FS techniques

# 4. Sentiment classification techniques

* Machine Learning Approach (ML) uses linguistic features.  The
* Lexicon-based Approach relies on a sentiment lexicon
  * seed words, and then searches their synonyms and antonyms with
    * dictionary-based approach or
    * corpus-based approach which use statistical or semantic methods
* hybrid Approach combines both approaches and is very common
  * sentiment lexicons playing a key role in the majority of methods
  * Fig. 2 as mentioned before

## 4.3. Other techniques

# 5 related fields to SA

# 6 results and discussions

# 7 conclusion and future trend in research

* Naı̈ve Bayes and Support Vector Machines are the most frequently used ML
  algorithms for solving SC problem. They are considered a reference model
