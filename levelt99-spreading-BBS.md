A theory of lexical access in speech production

#Abstract

* A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The
* Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process.
  * We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and
  * naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec
    after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly
* The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this
  process as staged and feedforward
  stages: conceptual preparation, through lexical selection, morphological and
  phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself.
* In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring
* The core of the theory,
  ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is
  captured in a computational model, called weaver++. Both the theory and the

  picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of
  accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production.
* handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors
* the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech
  production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.

# 1 1. An ontogenetic introduction

* language aquisition: two basic ingredients of word production. On the one
  * notions of agency, interactancy, the temporal and causal structures of
    events, object permanence and location.  This provided us with a matrix for
    the creation of our first lexical concepts, concepts flagged by way of a
    verbal label. Initially, these word labels were exclusively auditory
    patterns, picked up from the environment. On the other hand, we created 
  * a repertoire of babbles, a set of syllabic articulatory gestures. These
    motor patterns normally spring up around the seventh month. The child
    carefully attends to their acoustic manifestations, leading to elaborate
    exercises in the repetition and concatenation of these syllabic patterns.
    In addition, these audiomotor patterns start resonating with real speech
    input, becoming more and more tuned to the mother tongue (De Boysson-Bardies
    & Vihman 1991; Elbers 1982). These exercises provided us with a
    protosyllabary, a core repository of speech motor patterns, which were,
    however, completely meaningless.

Real word production begins when the child starts connecting some particular
babble (or a modification thereof) to some particular lexical concept. The
privileged babble auditorily resembles the word label that the child has ac-
quired perceptually. Hence word production emerges from a coupling of two
initially independent systems, a conceptual system and an articulatory motor
system.

 duality is never lost in the further maturation of our word production system. 
* Between the ages of 1;6 and 2;6 the explosive growth of the lexicon 
  * phonemization; words become generatively represented as concatenations of
    phonological segments (Elbers & Wijnen 1992; C. Levelt 1994). As a
    consequence, phonetic encoding of words becomes supported by a system of
    phonological encoding.  Adults produce words by spelling them out as a
    pattern of phonemes and as a metrical pattern. This more abstract
    representation in turn guides phonetic encoding, the creation of the
    appropriate articulatory gestures.

* [first] multiword sentences: word order is entirely dictated by semantics,
  * One popular choice is “agent first”; another one is “location last.”
  * by the age of 2;6, increasingly complicated semantic structures present
    themselves for expression. Clearly driven by a genetic endowment, children
  * system of lexical concepts restructured by a process of syntactization.
    Lexical concepts acquire syntactic category and subcategorization features
    * verbs acquire specifications of how their semantic arguments (such as
      agent or recipient) are to be mapped onto syntactic relations (such as
      subject or object)
    * nouns may acquire properties for the regulation of syntactic agreement,
      such as gender, and so forth. More technically speaking, the child
    * closed class vocabulary, a relatively small set of frequently used func
      * by the age of 4 years. From then on, producing a word always involves
        the selection of the appropriate lemma.

The original two-pronged system thus develops into a four-tiered processing
device. In producing a content word, we, as adult speakers, first go from a
lexical concept to its lemma. After retrieval of the lemma, we turn to the
word’s phonological code and use it to compute a phonetic-articulatory gesture.
