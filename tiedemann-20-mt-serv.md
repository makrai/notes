# Abstract

* OPUS-MT a project for the development of free resources and tools for MT
  * currently a repository of over 1,000 pre-trained neural MT models that are
    ready to be launched in on-line translation services. For this we also
    provide open source implementations of web applications that can run
    efficiently on average desktop hardware with a straightforward setup & instl

# 2 OPUS-MT models

* based on SOTA transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT). We apply
  Marian-NMT in our framework, a stable production-ready NMT toolbox with
  efficient training and decoding capabilities (Junczys-Dowmunt+ 2018). Our
* trained on freely available parallel corpora
  collected in the large bitext repository OPUS 3 (Tiedemann, 2012).
