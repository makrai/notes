# Abstract

* database containing recordings of mild to moderate emotionally colored
  responses to a series of laboratory-based emotion induction tasks
  * accompanied by information on self-report of emotion and intensity,
    continuous trace-style ratings of valence and intensity, the sex of the
    participant, the sex of the experimenter, the active or passive nature of
    the induction task, and it gives researchers the opportunity
  * people from more than one culture

# 1 Introduction

# 2 The Database

* Each task = context designed to elicit an emotional state, strong enough to
  reveal individual differences between encoders, but not strong enough to
  cause ethical concerns
  * participants expressing emotion—referred to as “encoders” and emotional
  * rating information from other participants— referred to as “decoders”)
* relatively artificial setting of a laboratory
* tasks vary in their effectiveness at inducing the expected or “target” emo
  * (as measured by emotion self-report), varying from only
  * 35 percent of encoders reporting Frustration to 92 percent report Amusement
  * because the encoder is different, and their emotional reaction to the fixed
    context may vary for a range of reasons including their appraisal of the
    situation [18]
* The database is divided into three broad sets that represent a categ based on
  * chronological periods in which the stimuli were collected and differing
  * research goals for collecting the stimuli. Table 1 provides a brief summary
