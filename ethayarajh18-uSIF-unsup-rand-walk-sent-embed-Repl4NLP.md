Unsupervised Random Walk Sentence Embeddings: A Strong but Simple Baseline
Rep4NLP@ACL 2018

# Abstract

* SIF [outperforms] LSTMs on textual similarity tasks
* we
  * show that word vector length has a confounding effect
    on the probability of a sentence ... in Arora+ ’s model
  * propose a random walk model that is robust to this confound
  * probability of word ... is inversely related 
    to the angular distance between the word and sentence embeddings
  * beats Arora+ ’s by up to 44.4% on textual similarity tasks and is
    competitive with state-of-the-art methods
  * no hyperparameter tuning
