# Abstract

* we: a diachronic analysis of the
  grammaticalization of a marker of negation into a yes/no question particle
  in Chinese
  * the input to the reanalysis was a vP-neg-vP disjunctive question in which
    the second vP was projected by a negative auxiliary
  * Head movement of this auxiliary to the head of an immediately dominating
    disjunction phrase allowed the negator to enter into an Agree relation with
    interrogative C and check the [Q] feature there
  * In time, the negator acquired the [uQ] feature
    originally on the disjunction
  * negator subsequently be base merged in C and function as a Q particle
