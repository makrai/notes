8. The Ideographic Myth
John DeFrancis
From the book The Chinese Language Published by University of Hawaii Press 1984

* The concept of ideographic writing is a most seductive notion. There is great
  * ie written symbols conveying their message directly to our minds, thus
    bypassing the restrictive intermediary of speech. And it seems so
  * eg a road sign, a death's head label on a bottle of medicine, a number on a
  * Chinese characters are a phonetic, not an ideographic, system of writing,
  * Here I would go further: There never has been, and never can be, such a
    thing as an ideographic system of writing. How then did this concept
    
# Origin of the Myth

* stimulated by the generally highly laudatory writings of
  Catholic missionaries from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The
  * first Western account of the fascinatingly different/Chinese writing was
    the comment made by the Portuguese Dominican Friar Gaspar da Cruz in 1569:
    * The Chinas [Chinese] have no fixed letters in their writing, for all that
    * signifying each thing by a character in such sort that one only character
      signifies "Heaven," another "earth," and another "man," and so forth with
      [Boxer 1953:161-162]
  * repeated by Juan Gonzales de Mendoza in a book that went through thirty
    editions in the principal European languages before the end of the century.
  * renowned Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci (1552-1610). His
    * original manuscript, written in Italian, was not published until 1942,
    * Latin version of Ricci's observations by Nicola Trigault, as the basis
      * published in 1615 and went through
      * ten editions in various European languages in the next few decades
    * a system of writing "similar to the hieroglyphic signs of the Egyptians"
    * they paint as many symbols as there are words."
    * "each word has its own hieroglyphic character," that "there are no fewer"
    * though thanks to combining them the characters "do not exceed seventy to
      eighty thousand" (Trigault 1615:25-29, 144).

  * huge eighteenth-century collection of missionary reports and essays
    * entitled Mémoires concernant l'histoire, les sciences, les arts, les
      moeurs, les usages, &c des Chinois, par les missionaries de Pekin. Here
    * author: "Ko, Jés", a Chinese convert who spent some time in France and
    * characters are composed of symbols and images, and that these
    * symbols and images, not having any sound, can be read in all languages,
    * a sort of intellectual painting, a metaphysical and ideal algebra, which
      conveys thoughts by analogy, by relation, by convention, and so on.
  * expanded on by the well-known Father J. J. M. Amiot in a longer article in
    * characters as images and symbols which speak to the mind through the eyes
    * Images and symbols which are not tied to any sound and can be read in all
      languages. ... I would be quite inclined to define Chinese characters as
    * the pictorial algebra of the sciences and the arts. In truth, a
    * a sentence is as much stripped of all intermediaries as is the most
      rigorously bare algebraic demonstration. [Mémoires 1776:282-285]
  * no term for writing that conveys ideas without regard to sound 
    * Friar Gaspar da Cruz, as noted above, referred to the Chinese symbols as
      "characters," and the
    * Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignani, who visited Macao in 1577,
      referred to Chinese characters as "that innumberable multitude of
      exceedingly intricate ciphers which pass for writing" among the Chinese
    * for the next 250 years and more: "characters" and "symbols."

* decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing following Napoleon's conquests
  => coining of several expressions related to the ideographic idea. According
  * English term "ideographic" was first used in 1822 to describe Egyptian
  * French term "idéographique" was first used in the same year (Robert)
  * French scholar Champollion deciphering the Egyptian script. It turns out
  * the English term represents a direct transliteration of the French

* Decipherment of this script had long been impeded by the notion that it was
  symbolic of ideas, particularly mystical or spiritual ones. It was not just
  * discovery of the famous Rosetta Stone, with its bilingual text in three
    scripts (Hieroglyphic Egyptian, Demotic Egyptian, and Greek) that made this
  * Gordon (1968:24) stresses: "The decipherment of Hieroglyphic Egyptian
    required the replacement of the deep-seated notion of symbolism by the
    correct view that the main (though not the only) feature of the script is
    phonetic."

* Champollion's success was due to his recognition of its phonetic aspect He
  * what he called "the alphabet of the phonetic hieroglyphs" existed in Egypt
    "at a far distant time," that it was first "a necessary part" of the
    hieroglyphic script, and that later it was also used to transcribe "the
    proper names of peoples, countries, cities, rulers, and individual
    foreigners who had to be commemorated in historic texts or monumental
  * recent authority: "The system of hieroglyphic writing has two basic featur
    * representable objects are portrayed as pictures (ideograms), and second,
    * the picture signs are given the phonetic value of the word for the
      represented objects (phonograms)
    * At the same time, these signs are also written to designate homonyms,
      similar-sounding words" (Brunner 1974:854). The same authority also
    * "hieroglyphs were from the very beginning phonetic symbols.  ... Egyptian
    * it could unequivocally fix any word, including all derivatives and all
      grammatical forms" (Brunner 1974:853-855).

* Champollion, however, overemphasized the use of "phonetic hieroglyphs" in
  transcribing foreign names (in his account this seems to be their only use),
  * Champollion calling Egyptian symbols "ideograms" and the writ ideographic
  * Champollion on Chinese
    * referring to the use of the symbols to write words foreign to the
    * The Chinese, who also use an ideographic script, have exactly the same
      provision, created for the same reason." It is ironic that the scholar
  * reinforced the popular misconception of both the Egyptian and Chinese
