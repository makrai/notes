# Abstract

* Existing benchmarks are not designed to measure progress in applied settings,
* The RAFT benchmark (Real-world Annotated Few-shot Tasks) focuses on naturally
  * evaluation setup that mirrors deployment.  Baseline evaluations on RAFT
* current techniques struggle with
  * reasoning over long texts and tasks with many classes
* Human: some classification tasks are difficult for non-expert humans,
* hE even non-expert human baseline F1 scores exceed GPT-3 by an average of
  0.11
* leaderboard will track which model improvements benefit the real-world
