SimLex-999: Evaluating Semantic Models With (Genuine) Similarity Estimation
2014 arXiv:1408.3456v1 [cs.CL] 15 Aug 2014 

# Abstract

* We present SimLex-999, 
  * a gold standard resource for evaluating distributional semantic models 
  * similarity rather than association or relatedness so that 
    * (Freud, psychology) have a low rating
  * rating of concreteness and (free) association strength
  * inter-annotator agreement
    * existing gold standard evaluations, 
      * automatic approaches have reached or surpassed the inter-annot agr
      * SimLex-999: state-of-the-art models perform well below inter-a agr
    * therefore ... SimLex-999 to quantify future improvements

# 1 Introduction

* a range of names for conceptual relationship 
  * relatedness (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Agirre+ 2009), 
  * topical similarity (Hatzivassiloglou+ 2001) and 
  * domain similarity (Turney, 2012)
