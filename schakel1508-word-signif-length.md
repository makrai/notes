# Abstract

* we propose to use the length of the vectors, together with the term freq,
  as measure of word significance in a corpus
* Experimental evidence using a domain-specific corpus of abstracts
* A useful visualization technique for text corpora emerges, where words are
  mapped onto a two-dimensional plane and automatically ranked by significance
