* This paper tackles post-hoc interpretability for audio processing networks
* interpret decisions of a network in terms of high-level audio objects
  that are also listenable for the end-user. To this end, we propose a
* novel interpreter design that incorporates non-negative matrix factorization
* carefully regularized interpreter module is trained to take
* input: hidden layer representations of the targeted network as input and
* intermediate output: time activations of pre-learnt NMF components as
* Our methodology allows us to generate intuitive audio-based interpretations
  that explicitly enhance parts of the input signal most relevant for a
  network's decision. We demonstrate our method's applicability on
* eval on popular benchmarks, including a real-world multi-label classification
