* we propose 
  * a framework that can leverage general pairwise word similarity to
    * e.g. morphological word similarity to show the power of our framework. In
  * a novel neural network architecture that leverages 
    both contextual information and morphological word sim to learn embeddings.
* Experiments on an analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task 

# Abstract

* it is challenging to handle unseen words or rare words with insufficient
* inspired by the study on word recognition process in cognitive psychology, we
* we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that 
  * leverages both contextual information and morphological word similarity
    built based on morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings.
  * refine the predefined morphological knowledge and obtain more accurate word
    similarity
