# Abstract

* Humor is one of the figurative language categories, and it is mainly used to
  express emotions and sentiments
* self-deprecating humor: users generally criticize and put themselves down
  * a new business marketing trend, such as brand endorsement, advertisement,
    and content marketing
* our aim: enhance self-deprecating humor based marketing strategies
* We have identified 16 new features related to three different feature
  categories â€“ self-deprecating pattern, exaggeration, and word-embedding, and
  considered 11 humor-centric features from baseline works
* random forest classifier for detecting self-deprecating humor in Twitter
* evaluated over Twitter and two baseline datasets, and it performs
  significantly better in terms of standard information retrieval metrics

# 1 Intro

* The proposed approach follows a layered design in which 
  1. semi- automated process to identify candidate self-around instances 
  2. feature extraction and classifier learning for self- deprecating humor

# Section 2 The state-of-the-art techniques and approaches for humor detection.

# 3 Our approach

# 4 Formulation of various newly identified and existing features

# 5 Statistics of the datasets, including the data crawling and preproc

# 6 Experimental setting and evaluation results

# 7 Concludes the paper with future research directions
