FrameNet's frames vs. Levin's verb classes
ACL 2002

# 8 Conclusion

* FrameNet [has] roughly comparable coverage of verbs, but with
  * much more detail concerning the semantics and syntax of their arguments,
    more semantically consistent categories, and a richer set of relations
    among them.  The FrameNet lexicon
  * also covers nouns and adjectives, using the same semantic frames

# 1 Basic Compar

* Levin says (p. 22) that different senses of a verb will occur in different
  classes, but this does not always seem to be accurate (cf. Section 7.3).)
* As the number of categories in the two studies is comparable ...,
  one might expect that many of the FN frames would correspond to Levin's verb
  classes, and vice-versa.  There are many partial correspondences, but there
  are many significant differences as well

# 3 Using Corpus Data

* FrameNet's classifications [is based on] corpus examples
* In many of Levin's classes there are [members without corpus support]

# 4 Comparison of Groupings

* roughly equivalent: Levin Cooking vs FrameNet Apply heat
* Levin narrower: Levin Pocket + Put Verbs vs FrameNetPlacing
* Levin class broader
  * Levin social interaction  correspond, marry, meet
  * FrameNet `Communication_conversation Hostile_encounter Personal_relationship
Display_of_affection`
* Overlapping Groupings: Communication verbs
  * alternations leads to overly narrow classes

# 6 Comparison of Hierarchies

* Levin ... sections reflect
  * a limited attempt to group verb classes related by meaning together
  * little hierarchical organization compared to the number of classes
* FN define[s] inheritance lattices relating frames, but we have a
  * parallel, detailed set of inheritance relation[s among] Frame Elements
  * do not yet connect all frames into larger structures

# 7 Challenges for both treatments

* constructions that do not seem to relate to inherent lexical meaning
  * e.g. Locative Inversion and There-insertion ... are used when new referents
    are to be introduced into the discourse

## 7.3 Relationships between senses

* One solution ... would be to remove [_argue_] from Statement and move them
  into a frame that inherits from both Statement and Evidence. This is an
  appealing solution, since both the notions of evidence and of communicating
  are simultaneously required. However, the inheritance solution would run
  counter to the intuition that the speaking sense of words like argue is more
  basic than the evidential one
