Hubness-based fuzzy measures
  for high-dimensional k-nearest neighbor classification
2013


* One simple solution to the problem has already recently been proposed
  * a weighting scheme for the voting in the kNN algorithm [17, 19].
* We will have a closer look at that weighting in Sect. 2.1, while we
outline the motivation for our fuzzy approach.  Other than in classification
and _retrieval_ [26], hubness has also been addressed in other data-mining
tasks, as for example clustering [28], anomaly detection [24], _object
recognition in images_ [23] and instance selection (data reduction) [5].
