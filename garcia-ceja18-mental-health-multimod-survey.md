# Abstract

* Personal and ubiquitous sensing technologies such as smartphones have allowed
* Machine learning methods have been applied to continuous sensor data to
  predict user contextual information such as
  location, mood, physical activity, etc
* growing interest in ubiquitous sensing technologies for mental health care
  * automatic continuous monitoring of different mental conditions such as
    depression, anxiety, stress, and so on
* we surveysrecent research works in mental health monitoring systems (MHMS)
  using sensor data and machine learning
  * focused on mental disorders/conditions such as:
    depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, stress, etc
  * classification taxonomy to guide the review of related works and present
    the overall phases of MHMS
  * research challenges in the field and future opportunities are also
