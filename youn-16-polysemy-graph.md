* On the universal structure of human lexical semantics

# Abstract

* polysemy
  * where a particular language uses a single “polysemous” word to express
    multiple concepts that another language represents using distinct words.
  * measure of their semantic proximity
* network
  * weighted edges
    * use the frequency of ... polysemies linking two concepts as a measure of
      their semantic proximity
  * This network is highly structured:
    * Certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than others, and
    * naturally interpretable clusters of closely related concepts emerge.

# [Intro]

* methods of typology and universals research (12, 16–18)
  * (SI Appendix, section I).
* a subset of concepts from the Swadesh list (25–28)
  * we chose 22 concepts that refer to
    * material entities (e.g., STONE, EARTH, SAND, ASHES),
    * celestial objects (e.g., SUN, MOON, STAR),
    * natural settings (e.g., DAY, NIGHT), and
    * geographic features (e.g., LAKE. MOUNTAIN)
  * rather than body parts, social relations, or abstract concepts.
  * The chosen concepts are
    * not defined a priori with respect to culture, perception, or the self;
    * ... influenced by the physical environment that speakers inhabit.
    * any claim ... needs to be demonstrated in these domains first
    * detaile[s] in Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, section I.

# Constructing Semantic Network from Translations

* these Networks are language specific
* The link is weighted by the number of such [languages]
* how similar are these semantic networks across language groups?

# Semantic Clusterings

* our web-based platform (29).

# Evidence for Universal Semantic Structure

* we group the languages by various factors (SI Appendix, Table SIII)
  * geography, climate, or topography of the region where they are spoken, and
    the presence or absence of a literary tradition
* we test the effect of these factors on the semantic network ... in several
  ways.
  1. the correlation between the commute distances (32) between nearby
     concepts (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, section III A 1).
  2. large-scale structure
    * we clustered the concepts in each network hierarchically as a dendrogram
      (SI Appendix, Fig. S8) and
    * compared them using two standard tree metrics (33–35):
      * triplet distance (`D_triplet` ) and the
      * Robinson–Foulds distance (`D_RF` )
        (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, section III A).
  * random
    * (A)
      * we compared each network with the one where the concepts were randomly
        permuted (SI Appendix, section III).
    * (B)
      * a null hypothesis ... that cultural and environmental variables have
        no effect
      * we replaced each language group with a random sample of the same size
        from the set of languages
      * no statistical support (SI Appendix, section III B) for that the
        differences between the language groups studied are any larger than
        between random groups of the same size.
  * Fig. 3.
    * (A) The `D_triplet` between the dendrograms of the Americas and Oceania
      * sits at the very low end of the distribution of distances generated by
        randomly permuted networks, but it is
      * well within the distribution by resampling random groups from the set
        of languages
    * (B) Comparing distance metrics, the Pearson correlation (r) between
      commute distances (32) on the semantic networks of groups and the
      `D_triplet` and `D_RF` among the corresponding dendrograms (33–35), on
      two bootstrap experiments to obtain p 1 (Mantel test or randomly
      permuted dendrograms) and p 2 (surrogate groups).

# Heterogeneity of the Semantic Network

* both node degrees and link weights [trend] toward a heavy-tailed distribution
* numbers of polysemies of [concepts] in any two languages
  * are strongly correlated with each other.
  * despite ... that the languages differ in the overall magnitude of
    polysemy,
  * formula
    * exactly what we would expect
      * (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, section II B)
      * if each language randomly and independently draws a subset of
        polysemies for each concept S from the universal aggregate network,
        which we can identify as an underlying “universal seman- tic space”
        (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
    * The data for only three concepts, MOON, SUN, and ASHES, deviate from
      this linear pattern
      * can be accommodated using a slightly more complicated model described
        in SI Appendix, section IV.

# Discussion

* For instance, SEA/OCEAN and SALT are more closely related to each other than
  either is to SUN, and this pattern is true for both coastal and inland
  languages.
* implications [for] reconstruction of human history using linguistic data
