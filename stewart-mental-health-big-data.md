# Abstract

* ‘Big data’ has transformative potential in mental health research, including
  * electronic health records and the ‘unlocking’ of text-field information
  * Over the last 10 years, we have made substantial progress in
    applying NLP within the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform
* ‘First phase’ NLP on CRIS focused on capturing highest-priority constructs for
* transformer models require less annotation for new clinical use-cases [4].
* temporal information, e.g. to identify the onset of psychotic symptoms [5] and
  * modelling complex entities from multiple keywords (such as violence or abus)
* combining computational and clinical expertise is crucial for these innov to
* synthetic clinical text data, that can be accessed more widely for method
  development before deploying on real data [6]. Applied clinical NLP thus shows
