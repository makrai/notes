# Abstract

* we explore the enrichment in the machine translation output
  when the training parallel corpus is augmented with sentiment analysis. The
  * same sentiment tagged English-Bengali parallel corpus. The
  * preparation of raw parallel corpus,
  * sentiment analysis of the sentences and the training of
  * a Character Based Neural Machine Translation model using the same has been
    * compared with a base-line translation model
      using automated metrics such as BLEU and TER as well as manually.
