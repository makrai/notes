    Weintraub (1989).
  * LIWC applications

      (Francis & Pennebaker, 1992)
    * LIWC2001, LIWC2007, 2015, LIWC-22 (Pennebaker+ 2001, 2007, 2015)
      * expanded dictionaries and sophisticated software design

# The LIWC-22 Text Processing Modules

## Companion Processing Modules

### Topic modeling with the Meaning Extraction Method The traditional LIWC

* there are various types of topic modeling
* nL LIWC-22’s topic modeling feature was built in consideration of a
  psychologically informed method: the Meaning Extraction Method (MEM; Chung &
  Pennebaker, 2008). The MEM allows users to subject their text analyses to
  * factor analyses (SVD, or other methods) to discover dominant themes and

### Narrative arc

* the Arc of Narrative
* three underlying processes that are shared in most stories:
  staging, plot progression, and cognitive tension (Boyd, Blackburn+ 2020). The
* how each narrative structure “unfolds” throughout the story, providing
* the degree to which each text resembles a normative narrative shape.

### Language style matching (Ireland & Pennebaker, 2010)

### Contextualizer

* this approach is often referred to as “keywords in context.” The
* extract a set number of words before and after each appearance of the word

### Case studies

### Prepare (clean) transcripts
