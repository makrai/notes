# 0. INTRODUCTION

## 0.1. A Neglected Semantic Category

* In English, our main language of demonstration
  * [in] conjunctions, prepositions, and other closed-class elements + modals
    * modals both in their basic and in their epistemic usages
  * incorporated in open-class lexical items
    * bring ... these together into systematic relationships
    * physical force ... psychological and social interactions
      * psychosocial ‘pressures.’
  * in discourse
    * patterns of argumentation
    * discourse expectations and their reversal
* related to other cognitive domains
* history [of] concepts of force interactions
  * physics
  * Freud to the psyche ... psychodynamics
    * libido and drives, repression and resistance, id-superego conflict and a
      tension-reduction model for restoring equilibrium
  * meaning in language ... Talmy (1976)
  * Whorf (1941) ... the referent of a particular Shawnee root
  * psychologist Fritz Heider (1958) ... discussed force concepts in modality
  * Gee and Keg (1982) [for] motion concepts in American Sign Language
  * Sweetser (1982, 1984), adopt[s FD to] the epistemic senses of modals
* The method I adopt here
  * ‘cognitive semantics’ or ‘cognitive linguistics’
  * language uses certain fundamental notional categories to structure and
    organize meaning, but
    it excludes other notional categories from this role
  * categories are
    * most evident as ... expressed by closed-class forms across languages
    * prominent role ... in structuring lexicalization patterns
  * e.g. noun inflections that indicate
    * number of the noun’s referent
    * but they never ... indicate this referent’s color
    * aspect, mood, and evidentiality
    * force dynamics as a further member of this privileged set
  * how the semantic structuring evident within language relates to
    * perceptual modalities and reasoning
    * space and time, with properties of visual perception (Talmy, 1983, 1987)
    * Here: physics and psychology
      * naive as well as the scientific mental models
* this paper’s sequencing ... from [conceptually] more basic to more complex
  1. fundamental force-dynamic distinctions [and] diagraming them
  2. generalization over the traditional causative
  3. extension [to] internal psychological interactions
  4. [systematize] a number of lexical items that involve such psychodynamics
  5. social interactions
  6. modal system
  7. discourse factors that direct argumentation
    *a familiar phenomenon here called ‘vector reversal’
  8. other cognitive domains
  9. other conceptual systems

## 0.2. Illustrating the Category

* keep (on) VPing
* can (not)
* refrain from
* polite / civil
* have (got) to VP / get to VP

# 1. BASIC FORCE DYNAMICS

## 1.1. Steady-State Force-Dynamic Patterns

* two forces
* role difference between the two entities exerting the forces
  * the salient issue ... is whether [the Agonist] is able to manifest its
    force tendency
  * Antagonist ... considered for the effect that it has on the Agonist,
  * Borrowing the terms from ... muscle pairs
  * diagraming: circle and ... concave figure
* [Agonist is] toward action or toward inaction
  * arrowhead and ... a large dot
  * the Antagonist [is] opposite that of the Agonist
* relative strengths
  * plus is placed in the stronger entity
* resultant is one either of action or of inaction
  * line beneath the Agonist, one bearing either an arrowhead for action or
    a large dot for inaction, as in (2d)
* closed-class-representation:
  * _because (of), although, despite, against, still_

## 1.2. Shifting Force-Dynamic Patterns

* change through time
* the motion [of a stronger] Antagonist in or out
  * a slash on the resultant line separating the before and after states
* the balance of forces can shift

## 1.3. Secondary Steady-State Force-Dynamic Patterns

* cases in which the Antagonist remains away
* corresponding to each of the steady-state patterns in (3), with an Antagonist
  opposing an Agonist, is a secondary steady-state pattern with the Antagonist
  steadily disengaged. Where this Antagonist is stronger, we have the two
  patterns for 'extended letting' [of motion or rest]
* conceptually derivative, founded on a negation of the basic steady-state
  forms

## 1.4. The Relation of Agency to the Force-Dynamic Patterns

* I regard ... nonagentive forms as more basic
* the inclusion of an agent in a sentence, though often yielding a
  syntactically simpler construction, actually involves an additional semantic
  complex

## 1.5. Alternatives of Foregrounding in Force-Dynamic Patterns

* a sentence ... can pick out different subsets of the factors [as] explicit
* I borrow from Relational Grammar the use of ‘1’ [for] subject, and ‘2’ for o
* Agonist/Antagonist as subject/object
* [foregrounding the] resultant ... or its ... tendency
* 1.5.1. Asymmetry in the Expression of ‘Make’ versus ‘Let’

## 1.6. Force-Dynamic Patterns with a Weaker Antagonist

* ‘despite/although’ formulations, where the Agonist appears as subject
* cases with the Antagonist as subject: _hinder, help, leave alone_
* there are four transitive verbs [other than perception verbs] that take an
  infinitive complement without to, namely,
  * make, let, have, and help

## 1.7. Particularized Factors in Force-Dynamic Patterns

* where a pattern’s VP factors is particularized as ‘be’ or ‘move,’ the
  corresponding construction generally also includes some basic lexical item
* _stay/remain, leave, hold_, and, once again, _keep_
* [if _move_] is particularized, say, as ‘down’ or ‘out,’
  * _1 hold 2 up/in,; 1 support 2_; and _1 confine 2_

# 2. FORCE DYNAMICS AS A GENERALIZATION p19

* earlier ones
  * such as McCawley (1968),
  * abstracted an atomic and uniform notion of causation,
    * often represented as ‘CAUSE’
  * Shibatani (1973) and Jackendoff (1976) [are more] complex

# 3. Extension to psychological reference 21

* psychodynamics ... generalizes notions of physical pushing, blocking
  * wanting and refraining
  * psychological ‘pressure’, ‘pushing’
* _refrain from, exertion (ráveszi, erőt vesz rajta)_

## 3.1. The Self Divided

## 3.2 Central vs Peripheral within the Self

* Agonist is desires, Agonist is supression

## 3.3. Psychological ... Force Properties in [non-]Sentient Entities

* language can ascribe intrinsic force properties to physical entities without
  sentience such as wind, a dam, or a rolling log
  * arising from underlying psychological force dynamics ... exertion
  * psychological component is normally included and understood as the factor
    that renders the ... stronger Agonist able to withstand

## 3.4. The Force-Dynamic Properties of Repose, Animation, and Generativity 24

* repose
  * an intrinsic tendency toward rest
* [the body is] essentially inert, requiring animation by the psych[e]
* recursion e.g. kepp preventing

# 4. FORCE DYNAMICS WITH MORE COMPLEX ASPECTUAL PATTERNS 25

* factors that distinguish the expressions within this set
  1. ‘phase’: the location along the temporal sequence at which focal attention
     is placed
  2. ‘factivity’: the occurrence or non-occurrence of portions of the sequence
     and the speaker’s knowledge about this
* the Antagonist’s foregrounding as subject
  * _try_ involves focus at the initial phase without knowledge of its outcome,
  * _succeed_ and _fail_ focus on a known occurrent or non-occurrent outcome
  * _finally_ and _in vain_
  * causative lexicalization)
* Agonist as subject
  * gap in English expression
    * with a nonsentient [weaker] Antagonist as subject [and] a stronger
      Agonist that is stably at rest
    * that would function as _try_ does for a sentient Antagonist subject
      * The wind blew on the hut with little/no effect / ineffectively

# 5. EXTENSION SOCIAL 27

* interactions between sentient entities
* sociodynamics
* analogy seemingly built into semantic organization
  * base of the metaphor is one object’s direct imposition of physical force
  * production of stimuli, including communication
* words like push and pressure, _1 urge 2 to V_

# 6. MODALS AS A SYNTACTIC CATEGORY FOR THE EXPRESSION OF FORCE DYNAMICS 29

* more core and more peripheral [modals]
  * degree of their showing certain syntactic and morphological properties
    * lack of _to_ for the infinitive form
    * lack of _-s_ for the 3rd person singular,
    * postposed _not_, and
    * inversion with the subject as in questions
* honorary modal verbs
  * regular verbs [with] meanings and usage ... close to those of real modals
  * make/let/have/help
* can (not), may (not), must not, had better not, should and ought, will/would,
  need not, dare
* subject of the modal represents the Agonist, while the
  * Antagonist is usually only implicit
* mostly refer to an Agonist that is sentient and to an interaction that is
  psychosocial, rather than physical
  * Only _can (not)_ and _will not_ appear to have regular physical reference
  * _Must/have to_ have limited physical usage
* nonsentient subjects
  * Agonist demotion
    * _The cake can/may/must/should/need not/had better stay in the box._
    * foregrounding of a Patient and the backgrounding of the sentient Agonist
    * `*`dare
  * epistemic ... the domain of our reasoning processes
    * _The pear could/may/must/should/needn’t be ripe by now._
    * Historically
      * psychosocial interaction extended ... to the ... domain of inference
        Sweetser (1984)

## 6.1. The ‘Greater Modal System’

* [the honorary modal verbs] all take the Antagonist as subject
  * modals all take the Agonist as subject,
* Previously treated cases of [syntactic-semantic generalization]
  * adpositions with geometric schematization, (Herskovits 1986; Talmy 1983)
  * conjunctions [as] relations between events (Talmy 1978a; 1978b)

## 6.2. Force-Dynamic Matrix Combining Modals and Open-Class Lexical Forms

* modals must take the Agonist as subject and offer no ready syntactic slot for
  the expression of the Antagonist
* open-class verbs
  * Antagonist, generally as subject, [and Agonist] usually as direct object
* one further factor [to the FD] system
  * abiding [tartós] vs
  * contingent [lehetséges, feltételes, változó], adventitious [véletlen]
    * _The ball can roll off the table (if it gets jostled [lökdös])._
    * needed ... to account for ... decisional behavior
      * _Dad says that she may go to the playground (if she wants)._
    * indicated in the diagrams with a dotted marking of the force tendency

## 6.3. The Force Dynamics of _should_

* (37) a. She should lock her doors when she goes out
* general form of the should construction as _E' holds that E should VP_
  * there is always some entity ...  that holds the implied beliefs and values
    * the speaker, or ... some generalized societal authority
* _The lizard finally moved._
  * the lizard ... knows nothing of outside social expectation
  * cross-domain clash between actuality and the speaker’s desires

## 6.4. The Force Dynamics of _have to_ [and _must_]

* implicit sentient external authority
* suggests little deciding and a sense of externally imposed pressure
* [the main] opposition between the self and the outside
* psychological projection
  * opposite to that in ... _refrain_ [where language divides the self]
  * here ... a psychological black box
* from a force-neutral selection process to a force-dynamic coercive pressure

# 7. FORCE DYNAMICS IN DISCOURSE: argumentation and expectation 40

* persuasion ... exhort [buzdít], to convince, and to logically demonstrate
* [FD] ‘argument space,’
  * each point can ... oppose or reinforce another point
  * each [encounter] can move the ... argument state closer to or further from
    one of the opposing conclusions
  * logic-gaters for English are such forms as _yes but, besides, nevertheless,
    moreover, granted, instead, all the more so, whereas, on the contrary,
    after all, even so, okay, and well_
    * analysys of _well = yes but, moreover, granted_
* discourse expectation. This includes the
  * moment-to-moment expectations ... to the direction and content of
    succeeding turns
  * vector reversal [is the] situation in which the
    * overtly observable resultant is agreed on,
    * but [different] set of assumptions about the underlying direction of
      implication

# 8. CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF PHYSICS AND PSYCHOLOGY IMPLICIT IN LING 43

* conceptual models of certain physical and psychological phenomena are
  * built into the semantic structure of language. These conceptual models
  * ones present in cognitive systems other than language. Relevant, for
    * e.g. in our untutored “common sense” conceptions, ... sophisticated
      reasoning about phenomena ... that underlies the scientific tradition
  * striking similarity
* Research [in]
  * linguistics,
    * Whorf’s (1956) work was among the earlier contributions
    * Talmy (1978c, 1987), Jackendoff (1983), Langacker (1987), and Lakoff (1987)
      * Lakoff: linguistic ‘ICM’s’: integrated cognitive models. Within
  * other disciplines of cognitive science, recent work includes that of
    * Gentner and Stevens (1982) asked subjects about their conceptions of
    everyday phenomena, protocols
    * Hayes (1985), with a formal approach to ‘naive physics,’ and
    * Hobbs and Moore (1985) ... a theory of common sense in an AI approach.
    * intuitive physics (diSessa 1986)
      * using protocols
      * abstracting the ‘phenomenological primitives’ that individuals use in
        understanding physical situations, has shown
      * striking parallels with the analyses of the present paper.
* physics
  * asymmetry between the privileged Agonist and the Antagonist
    * so natural in language-based conceptualizing, it has
    * no counterpart in physical theory
  * objects’ impetus in motion or tendency to come to rest.
    * in language,
    * historically earlier scientific theories
    * at considerable variance with modern physics.
      * Objects ... continue at their current velocity
      unless externally affected
      * stationariness is not a distinct state ... but is simply zero velocity.
  * greater relative strength
    * physics: two interacting objects ... must be exerting equal force
  * linguistic expression of causation is schematic
    * breaking caused by
      * heat ... would involve slow and gradual warping, spread of ...  cracks,
      * a falling heavy object ... would involve sudden localized disruption.
    * the [schema] is
      * a tripartite structure: a static prior state, a discrete
        state-transition, and a static subsequent state.
      * ‘chunk’ the complexities and continuities of occurrence
      * parallel conceptual patterns of naive physics
    * an ‘event’
      * a portion conceptually partitioned out of the continuum of occurrence
      * autonomous, without causal percursor or consequence, and without causal
        process during its occurrence.
      * _b. My cufflink finally turned up at the bottom of the clothes hamper._
        * may be inferred: agent has physically searched through objects
        * missing item ... depicted as emerging into visibility on its own
    * partitioning, isolating, and decausativizing
  * blocking and letting, resistance and overcoming
    * some of the most basic force-dynamic concepts
    * no principled counterpart in physics
    * For their viability, these concepts depend on the
      * ascription of entityhood to a conceptually delimited portion of [space]
      * entity’s ... intrinsic tendency toward motion or rest
* psychology
