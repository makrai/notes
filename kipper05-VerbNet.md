Verbnet: a broad-coverage, comprehensive verb lexicon

#Abstract

* Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon has concentrated on nouns rather than verbs
* WordNet does not provide a comprehensive account of possible syntactic frames
  ... associated with individual verb senses
* ComLex provides syntactic frames but ignores sense distinctions
* Dorr's LCS lexicon attempts to address these limitations, but
  * does not provide broad coverage of syntactic frames or different senses or
    links to actual instances in corpora
* VerbNet, a verb lexicon compatible with WordNet but
  * with explicitly stated syntactic and semantic information,
  * using Levin verb classes to systematically construct lexical entries
  * Classes are
    * hierarchically organized
    * characterized
      * extensionally by its set of verbs, and
      * intensionally by syntactic frames and semantic predicates and a list of
        typical verb arguments
  * coverage: VerbNet syntactic frames account for over 84% exact matches to
    the frames found in PropBank
  * mappings between [VerbNet]
    * verbs and
      * WordNet senses
      * FrameNet II frames
    * syntactic frames and Xtag tree families
* The original set of classes described by Levin has been refined and extended
  * coverage experiment against PropBank corpus instances proposed a large
    set of new syntactic frames and a better treatment of prepositions;
  * new classes from Korhonen and Briscoe's resource were integrated
  * new members from the LCS database were added
  * [semi-automatically], Additional verbs derived from Kingsbury's clustering
    experiments and from Loper's VerbNet-WordNet correlation experiment
