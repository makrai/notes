Code is coming soon at https://github.com/megagonlabs/emu

* fine-tunes pre-trained multilingual sentence embeddings using two main compons
  * semantic classifier improves the semantic similarity of related sentences,
  * language discriminator enhances the multilinguality via multilingual advers
* experimental results based on several language pairs show that
  * outperform the SOTA multilingual sentence embedding model
  * on the task of cross-lingual intent classification
    using only monolingual labeled data
