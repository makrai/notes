The Word Analogy Testing Caveat

NAACL 2018

# Abstract

* problems in the evaluation of word embeddings using standard word analogy
  * standard word analogy test implementation practices provide distorted or
    contrived results
  * We raise concerns regarding the use of Principal Component Analysis to 2 or
    3 dimensions as a provision of visual evidence for the existence of word
    analogy relations in embeddings
  * Finally, we propose some solutions to these problems
