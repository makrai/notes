# Abstract

* measure word similarity by comparing the overlap in their definition
* To acquire a large amount of word definitions in a cost-efficient manner,
  we designed a simple interactive word game, Word Sheriff

# 1 Intro

* Word Sheriff is based on the interaction between a narrator and some guessers

# 2 Word Sheriff

* After receiving each clue, guessers are allowed to make one guess
* game terminates when one of the guessers find the target word. 
  To incentivise the narrator to use a minimal number of salient clues, 
  the total number of allowed clues is decided beforehand by the narrator

# 3 Initial Limited Release

# 4 Data Analysis

# 5 Related work

word associations work such as Nelson+ (2004)

# 6 Future Directions and Challenges

* retrofitting
* a system should to perform both the guesser and narrator role,

# 7 Conclusions

* antonymy, hypernymy and common sense knowledge
* question answering involving reasoning about the physical world
* improve machine translation by using the word with the right definition, when
  there is no one-to-one correspondence between words in the two different langs
