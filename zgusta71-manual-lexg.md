# Chapter i: lexical meaning 21-118 17
## 1 Semantics 23
* nature of lexical meaning
  * psych
  * forms
  * regularity
  * contexts
  * philo approaches
## 2 The System and the Applications 24
* our sources are utterances but the goal of the work is their abstract value
  in the system
## 3 The Components of Lexical Meaning 27
  1. designation
    * denotatum and designatum
    * criteriality and negative criteriality.
      * asztal, table/desk (étkező-, író-)
      * morning
      * limbs
      * colors
    * (scientific) concept 32
      * animal
      * 33 középső bekezdéssel vitatkozni
        * robbery, theft, run, walk
      * new denotatum, designatum, word 34
      * fiction, abstract nouns p35
      * hello, please, this, not 36
  2. connotation 38
    * vulgar, emotive, geo dial, recently coined/obsolete,
    * info about the speaker, evaluation of the subject
    * humorous, ironic
  3. range of applic 41
    * stipend (teacher, clergyman) vs salary (official)
    * corned: only beef
## 4 The Actual Designation in the Context 47
* general and concrete meaning
### divergences from systematic meaning
* borderline between figurative (metaphorical) and lexical
### occasional use and figurative sense 53
* dynamism 55
### occasional::systemic and figurative::transferred 56
* the former is more general
### semantic change

## 5 Polysemy 60
* crane (daru)
### direct sense
* devour ((fel)fal) eat, zabál állat > ember, elpusztít
* the sense from which other senses can, in the semantic analysys be derived by
  ... some added connotation/figurative, special restricted language/style
* specialized sense
* crane: the source is already scientific,
  * not necessarily more frequent than the machine:
  * two direct senses
  * history
### transferred senses
* mag (gyümolcsé > gépé)
### specialized sense
* in a branch of science, technology, a polysemous word disambiguates
* table (architecture)
* airsen by MWE + ellipsis
### Constellations (borders of senses)
* some non-direct senses can be grouped with the direct ones
* borderline cases between senses
* when the connection is lost, homonymy
* table: asztal; tábla; táblázat. Munkafelület...
### Dominant sense
* one of the (direct) senses
* the first to be thought of
* frequency
* basic sense -- logical or historical
* historical aspect may be in conflict with synchronic state
* the logical apparatus may also clash with the language
### Treatment of polysemy, depletion, disambiguation
* depletion: the word _take_ is a little more than the verbalizer _-ize_
### Context: the contextual nuance
* contextual nuance: less than a separate sense, the difference inferred from
  the context
  * ~figurative
  * ~concretization of a sense
### Polysemy in system and in actual manifestations

## 6 Homonymy 74
* speakers are unable to concieve senses as connected
* etymology
  * intuition may be influenced by foreign language (the original language of a
    foreign word)
* homonyms with common etymology
## Homophones
same pronunciation, spelling differs
## Homographs
same spelling, differenc pronunciation -- treated in the dictionary like homonyms
## Partial homonymy
* morphology
* German gender, 82
* defective 83
* POS: Englihsh vs Chinese (Archaic, Modern language) 84
* history of langauge
* trans intrans
* lexicographic tradition
## 6.4. Criteria of homonymy 85
* difference in derived forms
* polysemy if relation has other instances in the language 86
  * crane, cat
  * causative-effect
## The presentation of homonyms 88
