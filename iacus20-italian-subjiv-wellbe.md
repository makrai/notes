# Abstract

* Since 2012, propose a subjective well-being index (SWBI) complementary to the
  * high time and space frequency, our team evaluates, analysing 
  * Twitter data is a composite index that captures various aspects and
    dimensions of individual and collective life. The SWBI is a 
  * multidimensional indicator whose 
    components were inspired by the dimensions adopted for the Happy Planet
    Index provided by the New Economic Foundation.  In detail, it consists of
  * eight dimensions that describe three different areas: 
    personal well-being, social well-being and well-being at work. The 
* Italian subjective well-being index (SWBI ITA), that we display here, audits
  * tweets in Italian and posted from Italy from January 2012 to December 2017
  * 1â€“5% of the data includes geo-referenced information, which allows us to
  * human supervised sentiment analysis method, the Integrated Sentiment
    Analysis (iSA) algorithm. 
* In this work, after a 
  * weighting procedure adopted to partially overcome the selection bias caused
    by the use of data from social network, we describe 
  * SWBI ITA dimensions in the considered period at the regional level.
  * for some dimensions, for which a similar currently available measure
    provided by Italian official statistics exists, comparisons are proposed
    emphasizing novelties, similarities and differences

# 1 Introduction

* evaluate well-being
  * Stiglitz Commission (Stiglitz+ 2009) proposed a great number of indices with
  * subjective dimension of well-being
    * essential like the more traditional quantitative dimensions (as economic
      indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product).  Considering the 
* traditional or official methodologies, the obtaining of subjective and perceiv
  * sample surveys that, despite all the 
  * attempts made (Schwarz 99; Schwarz and Strack 99; Kahneman and Krueger 06),
  * methodological drawbacks (Deaton 2012; Feddersen+ 2016). In short summary,
    * explicit questions can be influenced by contextual elements and the
    * non-response bias.  Moreover, conventional surveys are 
    * expensive and make it almost impossible to obtain high-frequency data or
      with an adequate territorial granularity.  An objective evaluation of the
    * limited and undersized presence of the subjective and perceived dimension
      of well-being (Iacus+ 2017). Trying to fill this information gap, 
* our team, with the aim of finding complementary indicators to the traditional
  * data coming from Twitter: as far as this work is concerned, we make use of
