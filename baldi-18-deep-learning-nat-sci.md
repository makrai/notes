> “A shower of little electrical leaks conjures up for me,
  when I look, the landscape; the castle on the height, or when I look at him,
  my friend’s face and how distant he is from me they tell me. Taking their
  word for it, I go forward and my other senses confirm that he is there.”
  (from the book Man and His Nature: Broadcast Talks in Religion and Philosophy
  By Charles Sherrington, chapter: The wisdom of body)
