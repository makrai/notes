* Inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KG)
* In this paper ...  predicting the relation of a given entity pair.  We frame
  * as an inference problem in a probabilistic graphical model and aim at
  * variational inference perspective. In order to model the relation between
  * we assume that there exists an underlying latent variable (paths connecting
    two nodes) in the KG, which carries the equivalent semantics
  * intractability of connections in large KGs,
  * we propose to use variation inference to maximize the evidence lower bound
