# Abstract

* In this paper, we
  * formalize a novel notion of infence based on reverse neighbor queries
  * present ... an efficient R-tree based method for large data sets
  * experiments with real geographical data, the proposed method
    * scale logarithmically, whereas straightforward sequential scan scales lin
    * approaches based on range searching or nearest neighbors are ineffective
      at finding infence sets of our interest
