# Abstract

* In this paper, we 
  * formalize a novel notion of infence based on reverse neighbor queries
  * present ... an efficient R-tree based method for large data sets
  * experiments with real geographical data, the proposed method appears to
    * scale logarithmically, whereas straightforward sequential scan scales
      linearly
    * approaches based on range searching or nearest neighbors are ineffective
      at finding infence sets of our interest.

# 1 Intro

* structure of the paper is as follows. 
  * Section 2 defines RNN queries and describes its relationship to NN queries.
  * Section 3 presents an approach and algorithmic framework 
  * we also propose a scalable method ... using R-trees in Section 4. 
  * Section 5 gives empirical results from experiments for RNN queries. In
  * Section 6, we formalize ... infence sets based on RNN queries 
    * qualitative study of the ectiveness
    * variants of RNN queries needed for generalized notions of infence sets.
  * Section 7 reviews the related work.  
  * Section 8 lists the conclusions and gives directions for future work.
