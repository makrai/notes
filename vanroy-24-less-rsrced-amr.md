Less is Enough: Less-Resourced Multilingual AMR Parsing
Bram Vanroy, Tim Van de Cruys
ACL-ISO 2024 Workshop on Interoperable Semantic Annotation @ LREC-COLING 2024

# Abstract

* multilingual models for AMR parsing,
  * English, Spanish, and Dutch
  * various configurations, including monolingual and multilingual settings,
    both in full and reduced data scenarios
* monolingual models exhibit superior performance,
  * nL multilingual models are competitive across all languages
    * more resource-efficient alternative for training and deployment
  * benefits from transfer learning across languages
    even when having access to significantly smaller datasets
* we make available 
  * AMR parsing models for the aforementioned languages as well as multilingual
  * the large AMR corpora of translated data for Dutch, Spanish (and Irish)
    that we used for training them 
  * the training code
  * interactive interface for parsing AMR graphs from text
