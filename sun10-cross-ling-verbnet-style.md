Investigating the cross-linguistic potential of VerbNet-style classification
CoLing 2010 Beijing, China


# 1 Intro

* Levin style classification for languages other than English
  * 59 verbs and three classes, Merlo+ (2002) applied a supervised
    approach developed for English to Italian, obtaining high accuracy (86.3%)
  * 60 verbs and three classes, they showed that features extracted from
    Chinese translations of English verbs can improve English classification
* recent verb clustering approach developed for English
  (Sun and Korhonen, 2009) and apply it to French
  * Basic NLP resources  are now sufficiently developed for this language
    * corpora, taggers, parsers and subcategorization acquisition systems

# 2 French gold

* we followed the idea of Merlo+ (2002) and
  * translated a number of Levin classes from English to French. As our aim was
  * an English gold standard which ... includes 17 fine-grained Levin classes
    Each class has 12 member verbs whose predominant sense (according to
    WordNet) belongs to that class
* The final version of the gold standard (shown in table 1) includes
  * 171 verbs in 16 classes
  * Each class is named according to the original Levin class. The
  * average number of verbs per class is 10.7
