# Abstract

* Creating expressive narrative visualization often requires choosing a
  well-planned narrative order that invites the audience in. The narrative can
  * linear order of story events (chronology), or
  * deviate from linearity (anachronies). While evidence exists that
    * can enhance story expressiveness
    * ? how they can be incorporated into narrative visualization.  To bridge
* we introduce the idea of narrative linearity to visualization and
  * how diff narrative orders affect the expressiven of time-oriented stories.
  1. preliminary interviews with seven experts to clarify the motivations and
     challenges of manipulating narrative linearity in time-oriented stories.
  2. we analyzed a corpus of 80 time-oriented stories and identified
    * six most salient patterns of narrative orders. Next, we conducted a
  3. crowdsourcing study with 221 participants: sec 5
* anachronies have the potential to make time-oriented stories more expressive
  without hindering comprehensibility.

## 5.1 Method

* We recruited 221 participants from Prolifc [39, 57],
  * Prolifc: a crowdsourcing platform for academic research.
  * Each participant viewed three time- oriented stories told with diferent
    narrative order patterns and answered a set of evaluation questions. The
