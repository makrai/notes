Stepwise Lexical Decomposition

# Introduction 5

* If we ask an average native speaker of English what a ‘chair’ is, there is a
  eg. a chair is something to sit on b. a chair is a piece of furniture used
  * in some current dictionary, we find paraphrases such as the following: (2)
* (or one of) the meaning(s) of a lexical item is defined in terms of the
  meanings of other lexical items of the same language. Given the fact that
* the meanings of some lexical items are more complex than that of others, this
  => a perfectly reasonable procedure, and
* one would expect this pre-theoretical common sense to be more or less
  directly reflected in theoretical accounts of lexical meaning.
  * hE This is not generally the case.
* Katz (1972:40) gives the following combination of semantic markers
  as an approximation of the meaning of chair:
  `(Object), (Physical), (Non-living), (Artifact), (Furniture), (Port­ able),
  (Something with legs), (Something with a back), (Some­ thing with a seat),
  (Seat for one)` (3)
  * and he adds that “this analysis leaves out a considerable amount of info.
  * ie the concept of (Object) might be further analysed as:
  `an organisation of parts that are spatio-temporally contiguous which form a
  stable whole having an orientation in space and
  * the other semantic markers in (3) could be treated similarly.
* eg2 murder,
  a native speaker would probably answer something like: (5) `to kill someone
  intentionally` and 
  * current dictionaries give definitions such as: (6) 
    a. kill (a human being) unlawfully and on purpose (ALD)
    b. kill (human being) unlawfully with malice aforethought (COD)
  * On the other hand, an analysis in the spirit of Generative Semantics would
  `CAUSE(x, BECOME(NOT(ALIVE(y)))) & INTEND(x, CAUSE(x, BECOME(NOT(ALIVE(y)))))`
  (7)
* this paper: native speakers and current dictionaries may well be closer to a
  reasonable analysis of lexical meaning than the theories of Interpretive
  Semantics (IS) as exemplified in (3), and Generative Semantics (GS) as
  exemplified in (7).
* The argument will run as follows: 
  1. certain basic assumptions underlying either or both of the two
    above-mentioned theories will be critically discussed
    * These assumptions will be shown to be responsible for the rather large
      discrepancy between the theoretical analyses on the one hand, and what
      native speakers and current dictionaries commonly do, on the other.
  2. a theory of lexical analysis will be sketched which does not incorporate
    these assumptions and consequently does not lead to such a discrepancy.
  4. Finally, certain difficulties arising in this alternative approach
* terminology: by 
  * meaning definition: any kind of attempt at analysing the (or some) meaning
    or sense of a lexical item; by 
  * defining predicate: any predicate used in the definiens of a meaning
    definition; and by 
  * lexical item: an element of the language described or analysed
    (ie of the object language)
