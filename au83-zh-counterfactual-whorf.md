* Bloom (1981) found that Chinese speakers were less likely than English
  speakers to give counterfactual interpretations to a counterfactual story.
* distinct counterfactual marker (the subjunctive) in English, but not in zh,

  + story used by Bloom. In these studies,
* bilingual Chinese showed little difficulty in understanding either story
  in either language, insofar as the English and Chinese were idiomatic
* For one story, the Chinese bilinguals performed better in Chinese than
  American subjects did in English
* Nearly monolingual Chinese who did not know the English subjunctive also gave

* ie the mastery of the English subjunctive is probably quite tangenital to
  counterfactual reasoning in Chinese. In short, the present research yielded
