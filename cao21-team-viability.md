# Abstract

* team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is
* we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to
* dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams
* We train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams),
  50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable)
  * then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels
* a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 AUC ROC under
  different thresholds of classifying viability scores. From these models, we
* the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of
  second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the
  most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a
  crucial signal of a viable team
* duration required for classifying
  * Only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds
