* It is nearly
  * 20 years since the concept of a small-world network was first
    quantitatively defined, by a ... high clustering and short path length; and
  * 10 years since this metric [applied to] neuroimaging ...  connectomics
* Here we
  * review briefly the foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation
    and generation of small-world networks
  * consider ... recent studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods
  * draw attention to the important methodological distinction between
    * binary or unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but simple
    * weighted graphs

# Small-worlds, Watts and Strogatz

* generative model (henceforth the WS model) (Fig. 3).
  * Starting with a binary lattice network of N
    * nodes each connected to the same number of nearest neighbors, by
    * edges of identical weight (unity), the WS model
    * iteratively re-wires the lattice by
    * randomly [moving] an existing edge (i, i) to (i, k)
  * as the probability of random rewiring was incrementally increased
    * lattice was progressively randomised,
* how small-worldness could be estimated in naturally occurring networks
  (Watts & Strogatz 1998)
  * Caenorhabditis elegans had
    * high clustering Γ ∼ 5.6 and
    * short path length Λ ∼ 1.18
