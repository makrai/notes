Semantic Density and past-Tense Formation in Three Germanic Languages
Language 2005

# Abstract

* We report a series of lexical statistics showing that irregular verbs
  * cluster in denser regions in semantic space. Compared to regular verbs
  * more semantic neighbors that in turn have relatively many other semantic
    neighbors that are morphologically irregular
* reflected in association norms, familiarity ratings,
  visual lexical-decision latencies, and word-naming latencies
  Meta-analyses of the materials of two neuroimaging studies
* conclusion
  * challenge the hypothesis of the ... formal encapsulation of rules of inflec
  * sensitivity to probability is ... intrinsic to human language

# Introduction

* irregular verbs of Germanic languages such as English, German, and Dutch
  occupy a central position in the study of morphological processing,
  especially after the seminal paper by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986)
* Rumelhart and McClelland,
  * and since then ... MacWhinney & Leinbach (1991),
    Joanisse & Seidenberg (1999), & Plunkett & Juola (1999)
  * regular and irregular verbs are processed by a single subsymbolic [system]
    * highly sensitive to the distributional form properties
* Conversely,
  * Pinker (1991+), Clahsen (1999), Ullman, Bergida, and O'Craven (1997)
  * dual-route architecture in which
    * irregular verbs are subserved by an associative memory system and in
    * regulars are processed by a separate symbolic rule system. The latter
    * two systems as competitive, ... never simultaneous
* intermediate positions have been defended as well
  * Baayen, Dijkstra, and Schreuder (1997) argued for
    a symbolic model in which the two routes operate in parallel, thus allowing
    synergy and temporal optimization of morphological processing.  A different
  * Moscoso del Prado Martin (2003) with a model consisting of a memory system
    [each] with distributed representations for form [and] meaning + a
    subsymbolic 'rule' system for mapping the form representations onto the
    meaning representations
    * a dual system in that it separates processes and representations, just as
    * all processes and representations are fully distributed, and
    * all representations are derived ... from large corpora and databases
* the past tense does not seem to depend directly on ... semantic distinctions
  * _slap, hit, and strike_ [similar meaning, quite different past-tens forms]
  * _sting, sing, drink, shrink, swing, sling spring, stink,_ and _ring_
  * the form system operates independently from the semantic system,
    in line with strong modularity assumptions about human cognition
* irregular [plural of] nouns of English ... pattern along lines of semantic[s]
  (Quirk et al. 1985). The probability that we find only animal names among the
  * subsets of irregular nouns that can be characterized by the coincidence of
    a formal property ... and a semantic trait
  * semantic similarity may even be a constitutive part of a productive rule
    (see e.g.  Bauer 2001:134 for semantic constraints on word formation)
* In the connectionist literature, Hahn & Nakisa 2000 [addresses] the
  inflection of German proper [nouns]
* Patterson and colleagues (2001), however, reported that
  * patients with varying d of semantic dementia had selective problems with
    irregular past-tens
* [irregulars have reduced phonological]
* several indications in the literature that ... a regular v ... in the
  semantic neighborhood of an irregular, it may be inflected irregularly
  * Bybee and Slobin (see als Harris 1993) report an experiment in which
    * time pressure the past tense of verbs presented in the pres ingly, a
    * errors involved irregular past-tense verb rectly supplied for regular
      verbs that were similar in meaning
    * _seat_ was often responded [with] _sat_ instead of _seated_ similarly
      _search_ sometimes elicited _sought_ ... instead of _searched_.  that
    * [suggests] that participants arrived in appropriate semantic domains in
      lexical m were attracted into the similarity space of the irregular
      near-synony
  * Ramscar (2002) [nonce words]
* we argue that irregulars
  * entertain more lexical relat[ions] and tend to be
  * more similar to each other in semantic space than is the case for regula

  * In what follows, we
    * lexical statistical surveys that docum[ent] a number of
      semantic dimensions along which regulars and irregulars reveal gra[ded]
      differences. We then proceed to show
    * how these differences affect association nor[ms,] subjective familiarity
      ratings, and response latencies in visual lexical-decision and [word]
      naming. Finally, we
    * inspect the data sets of two neuroimaging studies that
      * have b[een] used to argue for the dual-route model
      * s[ubtle] confounds of regularity and semantic density, and we
    * discuss the consequences of [our] findings for linguistic theory
