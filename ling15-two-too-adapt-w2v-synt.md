#Abstract

* We present two simple modifications to the models in the popular Word2Vec
  * more suited to tasks involving syntax. The main 
  * original models ... are insensitive to word order. While order
    * useful for inducing semantic representations, this 
    * leads to suboptimal results when they are used to solve syntax-based
      problems.  We show 
  * improvements in part-ofspeech tagging and dependency parsing
