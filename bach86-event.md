The algebra of events
1986

* parallels between the mass-count distinction in nominal systems and the
  aspectual classification of verbal expressions (Allen, 1966; Taylor, 1977;
  Mourelatos, 1978; L.  Carlson, 1981; Hoepelman and Rohrer, 1980) that has
* events: processes:: things: stuff. 
* The account draws heavily on [Link (1983)] on the count-mass-plural domain
* organization
  1. I review briefly the classification
  2. Link's analysis for the nominal domain
  3. our proposals about events and processes
  4. problems
