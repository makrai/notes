Formal Concept Analysis -- Mathematical Foundations
1999

#0. elements of mathematical order and lattice theory 

* a reader who knows what [a lattice is] may skip this

#1. (the "cross table") is defined mathematically ("formal context') 25

* "many-valued contexts").  These are then reduced to the basic type by a
  method of interpretation called "conceptual scaling"

#2. how all concepts of a data context can be determined and 
represented in an easily readable diagram
* implications and dependencies between attributes are dealt with.

#3. structure theory for concept lattices

part- and factor structures as well as tolerance relations

#4. decomposition and construction methods

* the concept lattice can be split up into (possibly overlapping) parts
* substitution
* doubling parts of a concept lattice

#6. The structural properties examined in mathematical lattice theory, e.g. the 

* distributive law and its generalizations or notions of
* dimension

#7. Context Comparison and Conceptual Measurability 249

* structure-comparing maps, examining various kinds of morphisms. Particular
* scale measures, occuring in the context of conceptual scaling
