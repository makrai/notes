# Abstract

* portable non-invasive human sensor technologies
  eg brain–computer interfaces (BCI)
* multimodal emotion recognition in the area of affective computing
* This review primarily discusses the progress of research into
  multimodal emotion recognition based on BCI
* three types of multimodal affective BCI (aBCI)
  * aBCI based on a combination of behavior and brain signals
  * aBCI based on various hybrid neurophysiology modalities
  * aBCI based on heterogeneous sensory stimuli
* For each type of aBCI, we review several representative multimodal aBCI syss,
  * design principles, paradigms, algorithms, experiment results and advantages
* Finally, we identify several important issues and research directions
