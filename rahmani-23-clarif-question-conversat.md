# Abstract

* conversational systems <~ The ability to understand a user’s underlying needs
  * especially with limited input from users in a conversation. Thus, in such a
  * Asking Clarification Questions (ACQs) to reveal users’ true intent from
    their queries or utterances arise as an essential task. However, it is
  * limitation of the existing ACQs studies is their incomparability, from
    inconsistent use of data, distinct experimental setups and evaluation
    strategies. Therefore, in this paper, to assist the development of ACQs
* we comprehensively analyse the current ACQs research status, which offers a
  * publicly available datasets, and discusses the
  * evaluation metrics, joined with benchmarks for multiple ACQs-related tasks.
  * research directions for the investigation of ACQs and conversat syss devel
