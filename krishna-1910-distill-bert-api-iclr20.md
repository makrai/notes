# Abstract

* model extraction in natural language processing, in which an adversary with
* only query access to a victim model attempts to reconstruct a local copy of
* we show that the adversary does not need any real training data to
  * random sequences of words coupled with task-specific heuristics form
  * on a diverse set of NLP tasks, including inference and question answering.
* for a query budget of a few hundred dollars, an attacker can extract a model
  that performs only slightly worse than the victim model. Finally, we study
* two defense strategies against [naive] model extraction
  * membership classification and API watermarking
