# Introduction

* deep neural network (NN) models have achieved remarkable results in NLP
  * Collobert and Weston, 2008
  * Sutskever+ 2014
  * Rocktäschel+ 2015
* Hill+ (2014; 2015a) showed that embeddings learned by NN machine
  translation models can outperform three representative monolingual
  embedding sets: word2vec, GloVe, and CW (Collobert and Weston, 2008). 
* [in Bansal+ (2014), using Brown clustering, SENNA, CW, Huang and
  word2vec] together achieved the best results
