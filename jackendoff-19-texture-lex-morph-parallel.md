# Abstract

* three interwoven themes:
  * a morphological theory,
  * the structure of the lexicon, and
  * an integrated account of the language capacity and its place in the mind.
* These themes together constitute the theory of Relational Morphology (RM),
  extending the Parallel Architecture of Jackendoff’s Foundations of Language

# Part I (chapters 1–3)

* situates morphology in the architecture of the language faculty, and
* a novel formalism that unifies the treatment of morphological patterns, from
  totally productive to highly marginal
* Two major points emerge
  1.  traditional word formation rules and realization rules should be replaced
      by declarative schemas, formulated in the same terms as words
      => grammar should really be thought of as part of the lexicon
  2. the traditional emphasis on productive patterns, to the detriment of
     nonproductive patterns, is misguided
    * linguistic theory can and should encompass them both.

# Part II (chapters 4–6) applying the theory
to a wide range of familiar and less familiar morphological phenomena


# Part III (chapters 7–9)

* connects RM with language processing, language acquisition, and a broad
  selection of linguistic and nonlinguistic phenomena beyond morphology. The
  * integration of linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, and human cognition.

##  7 Language processing and language acquisition through the lens of Rel Morph

### Abstract

* what is happening to linguistic representations during language use, and
  * how representations are formed in the course of language acquisition. It is
  * how Relational Morphology’s theory of representations can be directly
    embedded into models of processing and acquisition
* the lexicon, complete with schemas and relational links, constitutes the
  long-term memory network that supports language production and comprehension.

### 7.2 Theory of processing: Basic assumptions

* processing:
  * the nature of working memory
  * promiscuous (opportunistic) processing
  * spreading activation
  * priming
  * probabilistic parsing
  * the balance between storage and computation
    in recognizing morphologically complex words
  * the role of relational links and schemas in word retrieval

#### 7.2.3 The lexicon as a network; spreading activation

### 7.6 Acquisition of words

* acquisition = adding nodes and relational links to the lexical network. The
  * based on the Propose but Verify procedure of Trueswell+ (2013),
    plus conservative generalization, as in usage-based approaches.
