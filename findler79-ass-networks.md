# Foreword

* Associative networks, could, but need not, be language-independent
* three distinct levels:
  * an information structure in the computer;
  * a (corresponding) diagram on paper;
  * a directed, labeled graph with user-defined equivalence between
    * edges and nodes on one hand and
    * relations, restrictions, objects, events, actions, states,
     properties, on the other
* innumerable roads lead to "knowledge' and we try to explore many of them
