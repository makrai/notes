# Abstract

* an interdisciplinary field, called Affective Computing

# D. Computational approaches 2

## 1. lexicon based approach

* two sub types: 
  * dictionary based and 
    *  Most statistical approaches use Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
  * corpus based
    * Keyword based approaches define a set of predefined terms 
      * Strapparava used WordNet-Affect [34] 
  
## 2. machine learning approach

* Supervised machine learning
  * SVM is a tradition approach in this regard. Few researchers [40] [41] have
  * CRF [42] The supervised learning models are further of following; 
  * Decision tree classifiers: use the hierarchical recursive decomposition 
  * Rule based classifier: conditions in disjunctive normal form
  * Linear Classifiers
  * Neural Networks [46]
  * Probabilistic Classifier: assumes each class to be a component of the
    mixture which provides the probability of sampling a particular term 
    * Naïve Bayes classifier, which computes posterior probability based on
      distribution of words in a document [47]: 
      * Bayesian network, is an acyclic graph whose nodes represent random
        variable and edges represent conditional dependencies
    * Maximum entropy
* Unsupervised machine learning
* Semi-supervised machine learning
  * labeling is done automatically through hashtags etc [51].  Semisupervised
    * Bootstrapping [52] and distant supervision [53][54]
