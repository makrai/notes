# Abstract

* automatic sleepiness state detection using speech samples
* Interspeech 2011 challenge, we use the Sleepy Language Corpus (SLC)
* we are willing to record our own subjects within a collaboration project with
  the Bordeaux hospital, we focus only on the read speech samples of SLC
* we are looking for understandable cues that can guide clinicians in diagnosis
  * meaningful features that are close to the signal and restrict the feature
  * no feature combinations. Thus, using simple correlations and a grid search
  * 23 features, reaching a performance comparable to SOTA systems
* discussion is proposed on the
  * subjective ground truth used for the boundary of sleepy in SLC
  * interpretation of the features, physiological causes
  * physiological analysis of the vocal parameters for various levels of sleepy
* from the conclu: the choice of the subset of the SLC enhance the detection
* future: new database in collaboration with the Bordeaux hospital
