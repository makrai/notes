Relation Induction in Word Embeddings Revisited.
CoLing 2018

* we propose two probabilistic relation induction models. The first model is
  1. based on translations, but uses Gaussians to explicitly model the
     variability of these translations and to encode soft constraints on the
     source and target words that may be chosen. In the second model, we
  2. use Bayesian linear regression to encode the assumption that there is a
     linear relationship between the vector representations of related words,
     which is considerably weaker than the assumption underlying translation
     based models.
