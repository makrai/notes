# Abstract

* Shift work: working outside of normal circadian cycles
  ~> experience of both fatigue and poorer long-term physical and mental health
  * current methods for assessing fatigue present several barriers to
    understanding how these risks develop over time within individuals
* we: momentary speech activity-based fatigue measurement
  in a large, multi-lingual cohort of shift workers, using an
  * intensive longitudinal study design (twice-daily measurement over two weeks
    in N=1,197 individuals from six countries)
* Paralinguistic speech features were used to
  predict different aspects of acute and chronic fatigue at each time-point,
  * performance assessed in unseen (held-out) data
  * both across the dataset as a whole, and for user-specific prediction models
* Findings
  * cross-sectional analysis, good (close to or exceeding current SOTA) perf
    for both current sleep deprivation and self-reported sleepiness levels
  * within-user analysis revealed robust increases in performance
    * more subjective aspects of fatigue detected
    * eg pervasive physical and mental exhaustion
  * ie brief momentary speech samples are a low-burden, acceptable, and
    reliable measure of different aspects of fatigue
    in high-risk populations such as shift workers
* Clinical Implications
  * Developing brief, accessible measures of different dimensions of fatigue is
    an important step towards understanding
    how risks for poorer health outcomes develop over time
    within individuals exposed to significant circadian disruption

# Methods

## Measures

* we analyse data from three commonly-used speech elicitation activities
  (varied text-reading and image description tasks, all ∼ 1 minute in length;
  see Supplementary Methods), and self-reported work, sleep, and subjective

## Speech data preprocessing and data cleaning

* time since last sleep or time since last shift

# Data availability

* Due to licensing and IP considerations, the supporting dataset is
  * not generally publicly available. However,
  * nL we are open to partnering with research institutes and individual
    academics, including data sharing

# Supplementary Methods

## Study flow

* participants reading the study description page on Prolific, and
  * registering interest in the study, participants were routed to a
  * thymia platform page where they could view the study information sheet and
  * consenting to take part in the study, participants were forwarded to their
  * personal thymia dashboard, which lists currently scheduled study activities
* comprehensive demographic questionnaire, and
  * brief measures of depression and anxiety symptoms,
    suitable for use in the general population (the PHQ-8 and GAD-7; [34, 35])
* main part of the study (two available assessments per day for 14 days),
  * several brief speech elicitation activities, and
  * participants provided information about their recent work and sleep
    activities and current fatigue levels (total time 1̃0 minutes)
    * Activities were always presented in the same order on participants’
    * order of completion was not strictly enforced
* compensated for their time and effort at a rate of £9 per hour. Data were
  collected between November 2022 and February 2023

## Speech activities

* Three different speech activities (all 1̃ minute in length) were included at
  each study time-point:
  * "Read Aloud" (a paragraph reading activity),
    * commonly used in the scientific literature to elicit speech
    * Texts were taken from the previously-published speech literature and
      included the Aesop fables, The North Wind and the Sun, The Boy who Cried
      Wolf [56], and the Rainbow Passage [57]
  * "Read Aloud (Nonsense)" (a scrambled sentence reading activity), and
    * an increased cognitive load reading task, which
    * involves reversing the order of adjacent words in the previous texts to
      create scrambled sentences that are more difficult to read (see [58])
  * "Describe a Picture" (a spontaneous narration activity)
    * designed to elicit spontaneous narrative discourse [59].  In this
    * rich and colourful illustrations of human and animal characters, actions
      happening in the foreground and background, and displays of mental
      states
    * 14 different variants of each activity
      (ie, unique activities at each time-point for each week of the study),
      in order to minimise repetitiveness and maintain engagement
    * 1st week: different stimuli in the morning and evening of the the first
      * until all 14 stimuli were seen once
    * 2nd week: stimuli were repeated, in reversed daily order to the previous

## Self-reported fatigue

* measured using 10-point likert scales
* Sleepiness was measured using the item
  * describes your sleepiness level during the last 10 minutes
  * 1 = extremely alert and awake to 10 = extremely sleepy, can’t keep awake"
* Physical exhaustion was measured using the item "I feel physically exhausted
  or weary from putting effort into an activity (like a chore or a shift)"
* Mental exhaustion was measured using the item "I feel mentally exhausted or
  weary from putting effort into an activity (like a chore or a shift)"
* Lack of energy or anergia was measured using the item "I feel sluggish,
  drained of energy or lacking strength without having exerted myself "
* Lack of motivation was measured using the item
  "I feel unmotivated to do anything currently - but this is NOT due to feeling
  tired, exhausted. I just feel like I can’t be bothered"
