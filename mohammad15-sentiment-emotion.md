    * emotional or affectual attitude such as frustration, joy, anger, sadness,
    * feelings the general category that includes attitude, emotions, moods, and
      other affectual states
      * In this chapter, we use ‘sentiment analysis’ in this sense
* applications of detecting analysing of affectual categories in text
  * Public Health: Automatic methods for detecting emotions are useful in
    * depression (Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003; Rude, Gortner, &
      Pennebaker, 2004; Cherry, Mohammad, & De Bruijn, 2012), identifying cases
    * cyber-bullying (Chen, Zhou, Zhu, & Xu, 2012; Dadvar, Trieschnigg,
      Ordelman, & de Jong, 2013), predicting
    * health attributes at community level
      (Johnsen, Vambheim, Wynn, & Wangberg, 2014; Eichstaedt, Schwartz, Kern,
      Park, Labarthe, Merchant, Jha, Agrawal, Dziurzynski, Sap,+ 2015),
    * well-being (Schwartz, Eichstaedt, Kern, Dziurzynski, Lucas, Agrawal,
      Park,+ 2013; Paul & Dredze, 2011). There is
    * robotic assistants and physio-therapists
      for the elderly, the disabled, and the sick—
      * robots that are sensitive to the emotional state of the patient
  * Politics: There is tremendous interest in tracking public sentiment,
    especially in social media, towards politicians, electoral issues, as well
    as national and international events. Some studies have shown that the more
    partisan electorate tend to tweet more, as do members from minority groups
    (Lassen & Brown, 2011). There is work on identifying contentious issues
    (Maynard & Funk, 2011) and on detecting voter polarization (Conover,
    Ratkiewicz, Francisco, Gonc, Flammini, & Menczer, 2011a)
    * nowcasting: Tweet streams have been shown to help identify current public
      opinion towards the candidates in an election (Golbeck & Hansen, 2011;
      Conover, Goncalves, Ratkiewicz, Flammini, & Menczer, 2011b; Mohammad+
      2014)
    * forecasting: predictive power of analyzing electoral tweets to determine
      the number of votes a candidate will get (Tumasjan, Sprenger, Sandner, &
      Welpe, 2010a; Bermingham & Smeaton, 2011; Lampos, Preotiuc-Pietro, & Cohn,
      2013). However, other research expresses
    * skepticism at the extent to which forecasting is possible (Avello, 2012)
  * Brand management, customer relationship management, and Stock market: Senti-
    * blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts is already widely used
      to shape brand image, track customer response, and in developing automatic
      dialogue systems for handling customer queries and complaints
      (Ren & Quan, 2012; Yen, Lin, & Lin, 2014; Yu, Wu, Chang, & Chu, 2013;
      Gupta, Gilbert, & Fabbrizio, 2013; Fang, Chen, Wang, & Wu, 2011; Bock,
      Gluge, Wendemuth, Limbrecht, Walter, Hrabal, & Traue, 2012)
  * Education: Automatic tutoring and student evaluation systems detect emotions
    in responses to determine
    * correctness of responses and also to determine
    * emotional state of the participant (Li, Li, Jiang, & Zhang, 2014; Suero
      Montero & Suhonen, 2014)
    * learning improves when the student is in a happy and calm state
      as opposed to anxious or frustrated (Dogan, 2012)
  * Tracking The Flow of Emotions in Social Media: Besides work in brand
    * how emotional information spreads in a social network, for instance to
      improve disaster management (Kramer, 2012; Vo & Collier, 2013)
  * Detecting Personality Traits: Systematic patterns in how people express
    * such as extroversion and narcissism. Thus many automatic systems that

      & Yokoyama, 2011; Schwartz+ 2013; Malti & Krette- nauer, 2013;
      Mohammad & Kiritchenko, 2013)
  * Understanding Gender Differences:
    * Men and woman use different language socially, at work, and even in
      computer-mediated communication. Several studies have analyzed the
    * emotions in language used by men and women in these contexts
      (Grijalva+ 14; Montero, Munezero, & Kakkonen, 14; Mohammad & Yang, 11a)
  * Literary Analysis: There is growing interest in using automatic natural
    * analyze large collections of literary texts. Specifically with respect to
    * tracking the flow of emotions in novels, plays, and movie scripts,
    * detecting patterns of sentiment common to large collections of texts, and
    * tracking emotions of plot characters (Hartner, 2013; Kleres, 2011;
      Mohammad, 2011, 2012b). There is also work in
    * generating music that captures the emotions in text (Davis & Mohammad, 14)
  * Visualizing Emotions: A number of applications listed above benefit from
    * interactivity. If users are able to select particular aspects such as an
      entity, emotion, or time-frame of interest, and the system responds to
