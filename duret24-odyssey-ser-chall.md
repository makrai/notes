# Abstract

* We concentrated our efforts on the categorical classification of eight
* an ensemble of models, each trained independently and then fused at the score
  level using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
  * The models were trained using various strategies, including Self-Supervised
    Learning (SSL) fine-tuning across different
  * modalities: speech alone, text alone, and a combined speech and text
* This joint training methodology aims to enhance the system's ability to
* F1-macro of 0.35\% on development set
