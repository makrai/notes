Semantic Case Theory
Edward L. Keenan
1987

* semantic case as a way of extending the interpretation of NPs in simple
  contexts to more complex ones. The
* idea is developed from the treatment of scope in van Benthem (1986) and
  contrasts in interesting ways with the treatment of the same phenomena in
  Montague (1973) and Keenan & Faltz (1985).

# 1. NOTATION AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT STUDY

* I limit myself here to nuclear sentences (Ss) ones
  formed from simple one and two place first order predicates (PjS and P 2 s)
* Given a universe E of objects,
  * `P_1`s (and common nouns, like student) denote subsets of E, called property
  * `P_2`s denote subsets of E^2 , called binary relations
  * So for n = 1 or 2, a nuclear n-ary S consists of
    n independent NP occurrences, a simple P n , and no optional material
    * independent: not a proper subconstituent of another NP occurrence
* The class of NPs considered is extensive,
  properly including those denoting generalized quantifiers
  * An NP is called initial if it combines with a simple `P_1` to form a nuclear
    (unary) S
  * The initial NPs in a language are partitioned into basic NPs and deictic NPs.
  * Basic NPs are ones which may be adequately interpreted by functions from
    the set P of properties of the model into {0,1}, the set of truth values.
    * Such functions are also called basic
    * basic S = a nuclear S whose independent NP occurrences are occurrences of
      basic NPs
    * eg every student, some teacher, every boy but not every girl, no boy's
      cat, all but two boys, every boy but Tom, more male than female students,
      Bob's friends, most of the students, fewer boys than girls, John.
    * For example, every boy denotes that function EVERY BOY from properties
      into {0,1} which sends q to 1 (true)
      iff the property BOY is a subset of q
      * More generally, EVERY denotes that function from properties into basic
        functions given in (2).
        * For other definitions in this format see
          Barwise & Cooper (1981) and Keenan & Stavi (1986)
    (2) a.  EVERY (p) (q) = 1 iff p \subseteq q
        b.  SOME (p) (q) = 1 iff |p \cap q| > 1
    * Proper nouns (e.g. John) denote individuals, where
      for each b \in E, `I_b` = the individual generated by b
      = is that basic function sending a property q to 1 iff b e q
  * Deictic NPs are initial NPs which are not basic
    * To interpret nuclear unary Ss containing them we must know
      information provided by the context (of utterance)
    * Up to isomorphism then we may represent deictic NPs as denoting
      functions from contexts into basic functions. (I.e. in context _you_ might
      denote the same as _Fred_)
    * Such functions are called deictic, and
      initial functions are ones which are either basic or deictic
    * examples of deictic NPs: I, you, every friend of yours, the same student,
      he, most of the papers he wrote, a different boy, this cat

# 2. SEMANTIC CASES 2

* A basic unary S differs in a crucial way from a basic transitive (=binary)
  * unary: its interpretation is uniquely determined by the denotation of its
    basic NP and its `P_1` it is just the value of the former at the latter.
  * But interpretations for basic transitive Ss (henceforth batSs) are un-
    derdetermined in two ways merely given the two basic functions and the relat
    * We must state in addition
    * which NP is "logical subject" and which "logical object", and given this,
      we must state their relative semantic scopes
    * I make no committment as to how a lang syntactically presents its batSs
      * So e.g.  "scope" is independent of syntactic relations like C-command.
    * two readings of (4):
      (4) Every student kissed some teacher
* On the "object narrow scope" reading (4) is true iff
  the basic function EVERY STUDENT holds of
  the property expressed by _kissed some teacher_
  * To build this property
    from the binary relation KISS and the basic function SOME TEACHER
    we shall extend the domain of the latter
    so that it sends binary relations to properties
    (in addition to sending properties to truth values)
  * Specifically this extended function must
    send KISS to the set of objects a which are such that the basic function
    SOME TEACHER holds of the set of things a bears the KISS relation to
  (5)
  * For F basic, `F_acc` or the accusative case extension of F is
    that extension of F which sends each binary relation R
    to {a: F ( R_a ) = 1}
    where R_a =_def {b : ( a , b ) \in R }
  * ACC is that function sending each basic F to F acc
  * the object narrow scope reading of (4) is given by
    (EVERY STUDENT) [ (SOME TEACHER)_acc (KISS)].
* To get the object wide scope reading of (4) we want to say that
  some teacher has the property that _every student kissed him_
  * we extend the domain of EVERY STUDENT :
    (EVERY STUDENT)_nom takes KISS to the set of objects a which are such that
    the basic function EVERY STUDENT holds of the set of objects which bear the
    KISS relation to a them
  (6)
  * For F basic, `F_nom` or the nominative case extension of F is
    that extension of F which sends each binary relation R to {b: F(R^b) = 1}.
    (R^b = Â« {a: (a,b) e R})
  * NOM is that function sending each basic F to F nom .
  The object wide scope reading of (4) then is given by
  (SOME TEACHER) [(EVERY STUDENT) nom (KISS)].
* NOM and ACC are called semantic cases.
* Informally, note that the nom. ext. of David sends KISS to the set of objects
  which David kissed. Formally,
(7)
`(I_d )_nom (KISS) = {b: I_d (KISS^b ) = 1} = {b: (d,b) \in KISS}`
* Similarly the accusative extension of David sends KISS to the set of objects
  which kissed David.
* given two basic NPs and a simple P 2 , denoting say F, G, and R respectively,
  there are four 1 ways we may build a sentence interpretation, illustrated in
(8)
  F(G acc (R)) "G is logical object and has narrow scope"
  G(F nom (R)) "G is logical object and has wide scope"
  G(F acc (R)) "G is logical subject and has wide scope"
  F(G nom (R)) "G is logical subject and has narrow scope"
* Thus given two basic NPs and a simple P 2 ,
  argument structure (which is logical subject/object) is expressed in terms of
  which case extensions are used to interpret the NPs, and
  "scope" is determined by which of these extensions takes the binary relation
  as argument that one having narrow scope
  * purely semantic notions are expressed in purely semantic terms.
* extend in the obvious way to deictic NPs. E.g. NOM(THIS CAT) sends a context
  c to NOM[(THIS CAT)(c)]
  * Thus we may in general refer to case extensions of initial functions.

# 3. SEMANTIC CASE THEORY 4

* From (8) we have seen that given an arbitrary batS in an arbitrary L
  there are at least four ways it might be semantically interpreted
  Usually however batSs in a language are not four ways ambiguous (or vague).
* (9a/b) from English has only two/one truth conditionally distinct readings and
(9) a.  Every student kissed some teacher
    b.  John kissed David
* Neither of these Ss is argument ambiguous. E.g. (9b) is not ambiguous
* English constrains the acceptable interpretations of its batSs
* One statement of these constraints is given by:
(10) English Case Constraint (ECC)
  In a batS of the form `[NP_1, [V NP_2 ]]`, interpret NP 1/2 nom/accusatively
  * a claim about English and thus naturally refers its structural properties
    eg linear order and constituency with the verb. But the ECC
* several quite general properties concerning the ways in which languages
  constrain the interpretations of simple Ss
  * the axioms of Semantic Case Theory in the sense that
    all natural languages are held to satisfy them.
  1. (11) Case Existence (CE)
    The independent NPs in a batS are interpreted by case extensions of the
    basic functions they denote
    * motivation for this axiom: the Argument Structure Theorem in section 5.
    * the theorem says that NOM and ACC are the only ways
      a basic function may be extended to binary relations so that
      basic NPs in transitive contexts preserve, in a uniformly retreivable way,
      the meaning they have in intransitive contexts
    * If CE failed generally we would not be able to determine the truth
      conditions of batSs (up to scope and subject/object ambiguities) given the
      denotations of the basic NPs and the P 2 . So CE
    * rules out e.g. that every student might mean not a single student when in
      collocation with a transitive verb
    * we interpret familiar items in complex contexts in the same way as in
      simple ones,
      the only differences being induced by the complex context itself
      (i.e. does the NP function as logical subject or object, does it have wide
      or narrow scope)
      which cannot arise in intransitive contexts.
  2. ( 12) Case Distinctness (CS)
    The independent NPs in a batS are interpreted by distinct case extensions
    * if both NPs in a batS like John kissed David were interpreted nominatively
      the S would be argument ambiguous, depending on which NP had narrow scope
    * CE and CD jointly claim than
      * an interpretation of a batS determines a bijection from the independent
        NPs into the set {NOM, ACC} of semantic cases. They do
      * not preclude however that a given batS have two such interpretations. So
* ECC satisfies CD and CE (with respect to the batSs it quantifies over).
  3. that case interpretations of the NPs in a batS are determined as a function
     of the structure of the S ie Ss with the same structure have their
     corresponding NPs assigned the same case.
    (13) Case Structure (CS)
    Let T and T' be nuclear transitive Ss such that
    T is derived from (NP_1, NP 2 , V) in the same way that
    T is derived from (NP_1', NP 2 ', V'). Then,
    if an interpretation f interprets NP i and NP i ' by case extensions of
    initial functions
    then these case extensions are identical (i.e. both nom or both acc)
* E.G. given that (14a) is derived from (John, David, Kiss) in the same way that
  (14b) is derived from (David, John, Kiss), CS tells us that
  there is no interpretation f of English which interprets these Ss with the
  case extensions indicated.
`*`(14) a.  John kissed David
            nom acc
        b.  David kissed John
            acc nom
* CS applys to all nuclear Ss/NPs, not just basic ones, whence the NP variables
  * or even deictic ones, see section 4.3)
  * The if clause in CS is needed since
    some non-basic NPs are interpreted by functions which are not case
    extensions of any initial function
  * CS may be further refined by requiring that
    the corresponding NPs match in syntactic and semantic subclass.
* Japanese CC belowl
* having adopted the axioms, we may use them in stating CCs
  * For example, the ECC can be given by: "In a batS containing a VP of the form
    [V NP] interpret that NP accusatively". That the other NP, however
    presented, is interpreted nominatively follows from this statement plus CE
(16) Japanese Case Constraint (JCC) 2
  In a batS,
  * if there is an independent NP suffixed -o, interpret it accusatively
  * otherwise interpret some -ga suffixed NP accusatively
  * simplifications
    * in certain cases -mo is used instead of -ga. Second,
    * normally in main clauses one of the NPs will be topicalized, i.e. fronted
    with its -ga or -o replaced by -wa
    * the result of topicalizing either NP in double -ga Ss preserves the
      argument ambiguity.
    The two Ss only differ with regard to which NP is "topic".
  * entails, correctly, that (17a) is not argument ambiguous and that (17b) is.
(17) a.   Tarroo-ga Hanako-o nagutta
          Taroo Hanako hit
          "Taroo hit Hanako" *"Hanako hit Taroo"
  b.  Taroo-ga Hanako-ga suki da
      Taroo Hanako likes
      "Taroo likes Hanako" or "Hanako likes Taroo"
* The JCC differs in several respects from the ECC. First it does
  * not refer to linear order or VP constituency 3 but rather
    to the system of NP morphological markings. Second, in distinction to the
  * permits argument ambiguities in the class of batSs it quantifies over. The
  * consequences in terms of translation equivalences
    * not derivable from the CC for any given L
    * a structurally identified NP in one L is interpreted by the same case
      extension as that of some differently identified NP in the other L. And
    * in a situation in which
      the Japanese expressions in (17a) have the same denotations as their
      English glosses and in which
      the equivalently denoting NPs are interpreted in the same case extensions,
      it follows that the Japanese S and the English have the same truth value.
      That is, the one is judged a translation of the other.
    * it is to a significant extent these translation equivalences on which we
      rely in determing which NP is "subject" and which "object" in a language
      we are studying.
* on the basis of English/Japanese alone it is quite arbitrary that we assigned
  NP_i nominative case and NP 2 accusative. The opposite is just as good
  * But once the CC for one of these Ls is given
    that for the other ceases to be arbitrary in this respect. Had we
* the use of morphological markings on NPs to code semantic case interpretation
  * in Ls as diverse as Latin, Warlpiri (Australia), and Tagalog (Philippines).
  * batSs in Warlpiri present all six relative orders of the two NPs and P 2
    with about equal freedom
(18)  Ngarrka-ngku karli-0 jarntu-run
      man boomerang trim -past
      "The man trimmed the boomerang"
(19) Warlpiri Case Constraint (WCC)
  * In batSs, interpret a -ngku marked NP nominatively if there is one,
    otherwise interpret a -0 marked one nominatively
  * (correctly) interpret batSs formed from P 2 s translating "wait for",
    "accompany", in which one NP is marked -0 and the other -ku (called "dative"
    in Warlpiri grammars).
* both Warlpiri and Japanese show that there is
  no one to one relation between morphological markings and semantic case
  * markings on both NPs must be checked to determine semantic case.
* Linear order of elements will be crucially referred to in "VSO" languages like
  * languages eg Maori (Polynesian), Nandi (Nilo-Saharan), Welsh (Celtic), and
    Jacaltec (Mayan)
    * batSs have the form [V NP 1 NP 2 ] with `NP_1` interpreted nominatively
      and NP 2 accusatively. By
  *  Tzeltal (Mayan), Malagasy and Fijian (Malayo- Polynesian) interpret NP_1
     accusatively and NP 2 nominatively.
* Keenan (1979); verbal morphology is also an indicator of semantic case.
  * Schachter (1984); an example from Toba Batak (Malayo-Polynesian; Sumatra).
(20) a. Mang-ida si Ria si Torus
        see art Ria art Torus
        "Torus sees Ria" *"Ria sees Torus"
    b. Di-ida si Torus si Ria
       see art Torus art Ria
       "Torus saw Ria" *"Ria saw Torus"
  * P 2 s in Toba are presented with one of two prefixes,
    an M-prefix and a D- one
  * Main clause Ss with
    * M-verbs are interpreted "imperfectively",
      e.g. the action is presented as continuous or habitual
    * D-verbs are by contrast interpreted "perfectively"
      the action is presented as a single undivided whole. So
  *  the immediately postverbal NP forms a syntactic constituent with the verb.
     Thus the Toba CC can be given:
  (21) Toba Batak Case Constraint (TBCC)
  In batS including a constituent of the form [x-V NP] interpret NP accusatively
  if x = M and nominatively if x = D-
* CCs may also refer to verb agreement paradigms and NP subclass (def, animacy)
