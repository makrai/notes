Semantic Case Theory
Edward L. Keenan

* semantic case as a way of extending the interpretation of NPs in simple
  contexts to more complex ones. The
  * idea is developed from the treatment of scope in van Benthem (1986) and
    contrasts in interesting ways with the treatment of the same phenomena in
    Montague (1973) and Keenan & Faltz (1985).

# 1. NOTATION AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT STUDY

* I limit myself here to nuclear sentences (Ss) - ones
  formed from simple one and two place first order predicates (PjS and P 2 s)
  Given a universe E of objects,
  `P_1`s (and common nouns, like student) denote subsets of E, called propertie
  `P_2`s denote subsets of E^2 , called binary relations
  * So for n = 1 or 2, a nuclear n-ary S consists of
    n independent NP occurrences, a simple P n , and no optional material
    * independent: not a proper subconstituent of another NP occurrence).
* The class of NPs considered is extensive,
  properly including those denoting generalized quantifiers
  An NP is called initial if it combines with a simple `P_1` to form a nuclear
  (unary) S
  The initial NPs in a language are partitioned into basic NPs and deictic NPs.
  * Basic NPs are ones which may be adequately interpreted by functions from
    the set P of properties of the model into {0,1}, the set of truth values.
    * Such functions are also called basic
    * basic S = a nuclear S whose independent NP occurrences are occurrences of
      basic NPs
    * eg every student, some teacher, every boy but not every girl, no boy's
      cat, all but two boys, every boy but Tom, more male than female students,
      Bob's friends, most of the students, fewer boys than girls, John.
    * For example, every boy denotes that function EVERY BOY from properties
      into {0,1} which sends q to 1 (true) iff the property BOY is a subset of
      q
      * More generally, EVERY denotes that function from properties into basic
        functions given in (2). (For other definitions in this format see
        Barwise & Cooper (1981) and Keenan & Stavi (1986)).
    (2) a.  EVERY (p) (q)=l iff p \subseteq q
        b.  SOME (p) (q) = 1 iff |p \cap q| > 1
    * Proper nouns (e.g. John) denote individuals, where for each b £ E, `I_b`
      or the individual generated by b, is that basic function sending a
      property q to 1 iff b e q.  
  * Deictic NPs are initial NPs which are not basic
    * To interpret nuclear unary Ss containing them we must know
      not only the property denoted by the P, but also
      additional information provided by the context (of utterance)
    * Up to isomorphism then we may represent deictic NPs as denoting
      functions from contexts into basic functions. (I.e. in context you might
      denote the same as Fred)
    * Such functions are called deictic, and
      initial functions are ones which are either basic or deictic. Some
    * examples of deictic NPs: I, you, every friend of yours, the same student,
      he, most of the papers he wrote, a different boy, this cat

# 2. SEMANTIC CASES 2

* A basic unary S differs in a crucial way from a basic transitive (=binary)
  * unary: its interpretation is uniquely determined by the denotation of its
    basic NP and its P! - it is just the value of the former at the latter.
  * But interpretations for basic transitive Ss (henceforth batSs) are un-
    derdetermined in two ways merely given the basic functions denoted by the
    two basic NPs and the binary relation denoted by the P 2 . We must state in
    addition
    * which NP is "logical subject" and which "logical object", and given this,
      we must state their relative semantic scopes
    * I provide here a way of specifying these two properties
      without committment as to how any particular language syntactically
      presents its batSs
      So e.g.  "scope" is independent of syntactic relations like C-command.
      Consider the two readings of (4):
      (4) Every student kissed some teacher
* On the "object narrow scope" reading (4) is true iff the basic function
      EVERY STUDENT holds of the property expressed by _kissed some teacher_
      To build this property from the binary relation KISS and the basic
      function SOME TEACHER we shall extend the domain of the latter so that it
      sends binary relations to properties (in addition to sending properties
      to truth values). Specifically this extended function must send KISS to
      the set of objects b which are such that the basic function SOME TEACHER
      holds of the set of things b bears the KISS relation to. More generally:
(5) 
  * For F basic, F acc or the accusative case extension of F is that extension
    of F which sends each binary relation R to {b: F ( R b ) = 1}. ( R b - a r
    i a : ( b , a ) € R } )
  * ACC is that function sending each basic F to F acc
In this notation then, the object narrow scope reading of (4) is given by
(EVERY STUDENT) [ (SOME TEACHER) acc (KISS)].
* To get the object wide scope reading of (4) we want to say that
  some teacher has the property that _every student kissed him_. To build this
  property from EVERY STUDENT and KISS we extend the domain of the former so
  that it takes KISS to the set of objects b which are such that the basic
  function EVERY STUDENT holds of the set of objects which bear the KISS
  relation to b. Generalizing:
(6)
  * For F basic, F n o m or the nominative case extension of F is that
    extension of F which sends each binary relation R to {b: F(R b ) = 1}. (Rb
    = « {a: (a,b) e R})
  * NOM is that function sending each basic F to F nom .
The object wide scope reading of (4) then is given by
  (SOME TEACHER) [(EVERY STUDENT) nom (KISS)].
* NOM and ACC are called semantic cases.
Informally, note that the nom. ext. of David sends KISS to the set
of objects which David kissed. Formally,
(7)
(I d )nom (KISS) = {b: I d (KISS b ) = l} = {b: (d,b) £ KISS}
Similarly the accusative extension of David sends KISS to the set of objects
which kissed David.
We see then that given two basic NPs and a simple P 2 , denoting say
F, G, and R respectively, there are four 1 ways we may build a sentence
interpretation, illustrated in (8).
(8)
  F(G acc (R)) "G is logical object and has narrow scope"
  G(F nom (R)) "G is logical object and has wide scope"
  G(F acc (R)) "G is logical subject and has wide scope"
  F(G nom (R)) "G is logical subject and has narrow scope"
Thus given two basic NPs and a simple P 2 , argument structure (which
is logical subject/object) is expressed in terms of which case extensions
are used to interpret the NPs, and "scope" is determined by which of
these extensions takes the binary relation as argument - that one having
narrow scope. Note that these purely semantic notions are expressed in
purely semantic terms.
* extend in the obvious way to deictic NPs. E.G. NOM(THIS CAT) sends a context
  c to NOM[(THIS CAT)(c)]
  * Thus we may in general refer to case extensions of initial functions.
