# Abstract

* we
  * identify four fundamental criteria based on the characteristics of natural
  * develop tests that directly show whether or not representations contain the
    subspaces necessary to satisfy these criteria
    * Current intrinsic evaluations are mostly based on the overall similarity
      or full-space similarity of words and thus view vector representations as
    * We show the limits of these point-based intrinsic evaluations.  We apply

## 4.3

* [approaches to ambiguity]
  * Our results confirm that a single embedding can be robust against
    ambiguity, but also show the main challenge: skewness of sense
    distribution.
