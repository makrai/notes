# 1 Introduction

* The Spiral of Silence phenomenon [9] 
  * It is common in real world that people adhere to their own opinion even
    opposite to most of their friends [10, 11, 12], which we call
    self-affirmation of individuals.  Traditional opinion models fail to
    account for the self-affirmation effect of individuals. In our early work,
    the influence of inflexible units has been investigated in a simple social
    model [13]. It is found that this kind of effect can lead to a nontrivial
    phase diagram.
* directed small-world networks proposed by Sánchez et al [16]. In this paper,
* we present an opinion dynamics model including 
  * individual self-affirmation psychological feature and 
  * directed long-range correlation between individuals. The 
* parameter space can be roughly divided into three regions, in which,
  * continuous phase transition, discontinuous phase transition and no phase tr
