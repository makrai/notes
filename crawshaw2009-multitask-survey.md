* advantages like improved data efficiency
  * reduced overfitting through shared representations
  * fast learning by leveraging auxiliary information.
* design and optimization challenges, and
* choosing which tasks should be learned jointly is in itself non-trivial
* we give an overview of multi-task learning methods for deep neural networks,
  * both the well-established and most recent directions within the field.
  * structured according to a partition of the existing deep MTL techniques into
    * architectures, optimization methods, and task relationship learning.  We
  * summary of common multi-task benchmarks.
