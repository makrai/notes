The Role of Interpretable Patterns in Deep Learning for Morphology
MSZNY 2020

* We found two trends that coincide with linguistic intuition. One is that
  1. lemmatization and morphological analysis require patterns that match
     less similar subwords than the other two task pairs. The other one is that
  2. copy and morphological analysis are more similar in languages with rich
     inflectional morphology.
