Helene Tenzer, Markus Pudelko
The Leadership Quarterly Volume 26, Issue 4, August 2015, Pages 606-625

* multinational team (MNT) members' emotional reactions to language barriers
  fall into two discrete categories: 
  * self-directed anxiety and other-directed resentment
* we will systematically investigate strategies to mitigate the emotional impact
  of language barriers
* the measures MNT leaders have at their disposal: three major strategies:
  * reducing the impact of language barriers, 
  * redirecting MNT members' attention away from language barriers, and 
  * reducing the negative appraisal of language barriers
