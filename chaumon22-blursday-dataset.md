# Abstract

* The Blursday database
  * repeated measures of subjective time and related processes from
  * participants in nine countries
  * 14 questionnaires and 15 behavioural tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. A
  * 2,840 participants completed at least one task, and
    * 439 participants completed all tasks in the first session
* The database and all data collection tools are
  accessible to researchers for studying the effects of social isolation on
  temporal information processing, time perspective, decision-making, sleep,
  metacognition, attention, memory, self-perception and mindfulness
* quantitative statistics such as sleep patterns, personality traits,
  psychological well-being and lockdown indices
* quantitative insights on the effects of lockdown (stringency and mobility)
* subjective confinement on time perception
  (duration, passage of time and temporal distances)
* Perceived isolation affects time perception
* inter-individual central tendency effect in retrospective duration estimation


# Main

* Subjective time is one of the most malleable aspects of personal experience
  * can be altered by many
    * exogenous factors (for example, physical features of the environment and
      social interactions) as well as
    * endogenous psychological and physiological states (for example, arousal,
      attention, valence, febricity and circadian rhythms)1
  * An altered sense of time can be indicative of individuals’ well-being2 and
    misguide individuals’ decisions and judgements3. At a historically global
* COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and state-of-emergency measures
  * how the pandemic affected our sense of time, systematic manner examination
* The Blursday project tackles this challenge and provides a dataset for
  * participants (Supplemen Table 1) collected in 9 countries (on 4 continents)
  * during the peak of the lockdown periods. The Blursday database contains
  * various widely utilized behavioural tasks (performance measures) combined
  * questionnaires (self-reports), demographics and subjective confinement
    trackers (state measures). The database includes
  * participants tracked longitudinally in and out of lockdown (from 2020 on)
  * groups of participants tested for the first time outside of COVID-19
* why time perception is central, beyond the observation that
  * disorientations in time were a phenomenologically vivid and widely shared
    experience during lockdowns
  * all animals keep track of time at multiple timescales regulated by
    physiological clocks—for example, circadian rhythms, interval timing and
    motor timing6,7. Second,
  * interval timing in the seconds-to-minutes range is the most malleable
    because it holds strong ties with domain-general cognition including
    attention, memory and decision-making8
  * Timekeeping systems also interact with each other
    * interval and motor timing fluctuate with circadian rhythms, which is
      essential for the adaptiveness of other cognitive functions and related
      behaviours9
  * the accuracy and precision of temporal representations and behaviours
    influence decision-making10. Temporal phenomenologies are thus crucial for
  * ie how cognition generally and timekeeping specifically have been affected
    by the altered lifestyles and profound routine changes during the lockdown
* Recent studies have started showing changes in sleep patterns11,12,13,
  changes in levels of physical activity14 and increases in depression, anxiety
  and fear across countries515,16,17. COVID-19 lockdowns have been suggested to
  negatively affect executive functions, attention and anecdotally temporal
  orientation through the self-reporting of forgotten dates during that
  period18
* Self-reports on the passage of time during lockdown have been published. In
  * Italian study12, surveyed participants reported experiencing
    * problems with keeping track of the hours and days, and they also reported
    * an expansion of subjective duration + sense of boredom
  * French surveys 19,20,21, participants answered the
    * question: “What are your feelings about the speed of passage of time?”
    * The question was asked in reference to the individuals’ autobiographical
      recall of their experienced passage of time before the lockdown and was
      then asked three times during lockdown in reference to “now”, to
      “yesterday” and to “one week ago”
    * passage of time feeling slower during than before the lockdown was
      reported for all temporal scales
    * The best predictors of the experience of the passage of time were boredom
      and sadness, which contributed the most to the well-being
  * UK surveys22,23, participants reported
    a significant distortion of the passage of time in both directions,
    attributable to stress but also to age, task load and one’s satisfaction
    with the experienced social interactions
    * Comparable numbers of participants felt that the past day and the past
      week had passed either more quickly or more slowly than usual;
    * older and less socially satisfied British individuals were, the slower
      time seemed to pass during both UK lockdowns. In a
  * Uruguayan study24, which assessed the experience of university students,
    * an association between psychological distress due to the COVID-19
      restrictions and the feeling of a slower passage of time, a blurred sense
      of time (not knowing what time or day it is) and more boredom. In a
  * longitudinal Brazilian study25, participants initially perceived an
    expansion of time, which steadily decreased over the following weeks
* These surveys confirmed self-reported temporal distortions during lockdown
  * hE not converge on their underlying explanatory causes
  * absence of controls, which prevents assigning a causal role of lockdown to
  * cross-cultural factors and differences in the stringency of the lockdown
    measures played crucial roles in the different trends observed across
  * All studies used questionnaires and ratings, and none included psychometric
* The Blursday database includes a battery of questionnaires, tasks and tests
  (Table 1) across cultures, a longitudinal assessment of these factors within
  individuals and, importantly, control participants who are naive to all
  tasks, who are tested outside of lockdowns and whose number can be
  incremented over time
  * Table 1 Overview of tasks and questionnaires
  * captures subjective time and timing behaviours of participants on
    * nearly all aspects of temporal information processing (interval
      perception and production, spontaneous tapping, synchronization and
      implicit timing) together with
    * measures of working memory, decision-making, self-perception,
      metacognition, sleep patterns, personality traits and well-being. The
  * can incorporate new control data, although the current database already
    contains some control data (Methods and Supplementary Fig.  1)
  * all tools available online for researchers wishing to test participants
    post-lockdown using the same approach or parts of it. We fully describe the
    database and, importantly, provide examples illustrating its potential use
    based on a few fundamental analyses providing quantitative insights on time
    perception during this historical period

## Tasks

### Retrospective duration

* The vast majority of studies in time perception use prospective timing tasks
  * participants know beforehand that they will be asked to estimate the
    duration of an upcoming event or stimulus63. While helpful (see below for)
* hE temporal judgements are commonly made retrospectively in daily life
  * require individuals to estimate the elapsed time since a past event or
    during an activity that just happened without them knowing a priori that
    they will have to time29,63,64,65
* Cognitive components (eg attention and memory) are differentially involved 63
  * retrospective duration estimates assumed to engage episodic memory
* Blursday included retrospective duration estimations (Supplementary Fig. 3)
  at several moments after a series of questionnaires or after specific tasks
* Here we report the first retrospective duration estimate that the
  participants had to make in the study, which followed a series of initial
  questionnaires and thus spanned a scale of minutes to hours. The outcomes are
  included in the Results section and illustrated in Fig. 1

### Passage-of-time judgements

* can be used to estimate the subjective feeling that time passes
* commonly referred to as the ‘flow of time’34,66
* In this study, passage-of-time judgements were implemented either/or as
  * VASs ranging from ‘very slow’ to ‘very fast’ or as
  * Likert scales offering a categorical choice among ‘very slow’, ‘slow’,
    ‘normal’, ‘fast’ and ‘very fast’
* we used passage-of-time judgements after several tasks during the study by
  asking the participants to report how fast time felt in a given lapse of time
  (for example, Supplementary Fig. 8). We report the passage-of-time judgements
  that were estimated using a VAS and over the scale of the ‘last few days’
  (Supplementary Fig. 3) in the Results section

### Temporal landmarks and event recording

* By analogy to spatial landmarks, temporal landmarks are salient events
* eg one’s birthday tends to be an important landmark
* One way to assess the existence of temporal landmarks is to evaluate the
  speed (response time) and ease (error rate) with which one answers a question
  about a point in time
* Chronometry and performance can be driven by the psychological distance of
  that point in time from the operative landmark
* can be culturally and autobiographically idiosyncratic
* eg when participants are asked to answer as fast and as accurately as
  possible “What day is it?”, the closer a day is to a cultural temporal
  landmark (for example, Sunday in Catholicism or Shabbat in Judaism), the
  faster the responses and the lower the error rates67,68. In
* we prompted the participants at various times with the question “What day is
  it today?” and asked them to report an important event for them on that same
  day (Supplementary Fig. 3). The distributions of the collected response times
  during lockdown in all participating countries are illustrated in
  Supplementary Fig. 5d

### Subjective temporal distance

* asking participants to estimate how far away an event feels for them
* involves episodic memory processes and the abstraction of temporal relations
  between events69,70
* we asked the participants to use a VAS to report
  * how far away their first day of lockdown felt with respect to the present
    (Supplementary Fig. 3)
  * subjective distance to a week and a month ahead: future orientation
* people may feel more or less close to a past 71
* The outcomes of these ratings are included in the Results section: fig 3

### Verbal fluency tasks: semantic, phonemic and timescales

* reporting as many words as possible within an imparted lapse of time, on the
  basis of phonemic or semantic criteria72. These
* tasks were originally developed for neurolinguistic and cognitive assessment
* our semantic fluency task: report as many animals as possible in 60 s, Fig. 6
* phonemic fluency task consisted here of reporting as many words as possible
  starting with the letter ‘P’ in 60 s. In addition to classic verbal fluency
* we included past and future event fluency tasks to assess the accessibility
  of mental representations of life events that the participants had
  experienced in the past or that they planned for the future73
  * prompt: “Write as many events as possible that occurred last/will happen
    next [week/month/year]” (Supplementary Fig. 6)
  * these fluency tasks tested the scales at which fluency was assessed—namely,
    over a week, a month or a year
* An additional semantic fluency task inquiring about associations with the
  word ‘time’
* All fluency tasks in the Blursday database were 60 s long, and the number of
  collected items was unlimited

### Prospective duration estimation while counting up or down

* attention and working memory influence their duration estimates. The
* non-temporal tasks (eg counting) have been used to show the impact of
  attention or working memory on prospective judgements of time74,75,76. One
* The participants were prompted with a prime number and asked to count up
  (addition) or down (subtraction) in steps of 3 or 7 as a way to control the

### Prospective duration estimation while performing an n-back task

* The level of processing in working memory lengthens temporal production,
  presumably by slowing down temporal integration 77
* another means to explore the influence of working memory on time estimation
* a sequence of letters is displayed on the screen and participants decide on a
  trial-by-trial basis whether the displayed letter is identical to the
  previous one (n = 1) or to the one two letters before it (n = 2) and so on
* increasing n may proportionally shorten the prospective estimation of
  duration, whereas paying attention to time may lengthen it in an additive
  fashion78
* we asked the participants to perform an n-back task (n = 1 or n = 3) and to
  report how long the trial was (in minutes:seconds) as well as how fast time
  felt on a Likert scale. Unbeknownst to the participants, a trial could last
  45 s or 90 s (Supplementary Fig. 8)

### Duration production and metacognition

* asking participants to estimate a time interval using overt motor behaviour
* Here the participants were asked to produce 3.6 s by pressing the spacebar
* Following each duration production, we asked the participants to assess their
  performance (which constitutes a metacognitive judgement task) and provide an
  assessment of temporal error monitoring79,80. In temporal production tasks,
* substantial variability within individuals that is observed is
  * assumed to result from the endogenous timing uncertainty between trials
* relation between the timing variability and the time intervals 81
  * organisms can access their level of endogenous timing uncertainty as a form
    of temporal metacognition79,80
    * might serve optimal temporal decisions in animals and humans82. Hence,
* we asked the participants to evaluate not only/but also
  * the signed error magnitude of their temporal production (using a VAS)
  * their confidence either in their temporal production (Turkey) or in their
    metacognitive judgement (most countries). The descriptive statistics of the
    duration productions for all participating countries in S1 are illustrated
    in Supplementary Fig.  5b

### Spontaneous finger tapping (free tapping)

* Spontaneous motor tempo (that is, the rate at which an individual taps in the
  absence of any timing cue) is
* universally situated between around 1 Hz and 4 Hz with a
* bimodal or even trimodal distribution of the intertap intervals (ITIs) (with
  peaks at around 250, 500 and 1,000 ms)83. The rate at which participants tap
* assumed to reflect the speed or the period of a still largely unknown
  timekeeper
* sensitive to ageing84,85. It has been argued that this is because spontaneous
* too simple to be compensated by alternative compensatory mechanisms—that is,
  ie not cognitively penetrable86. Basic information about the task is provided

### Synchronization–continuation

* In the field of motor timing, the classical synchronization–continuation 87
* asking participants to synchronize their finger tapping with an auditory
  metronome and then continue finger tapping with a sequence of constant
  intervals at the pace they initially synchronized with88. In the
  * continuation phase, the variability of the ITIs is the key dependent
    variable of interest88. When the stimulus period is varied parametrically,
    an autocorrelation analysis of the series of produced intervals can be used
    to sort out the part of observed variability due to the temporal component
    of the task (associated with the underlying timing mechanism) and the part
    due to the implementation of the intervals with finger taps (the motor
    component). The
  * synchronization phase, also known as paced finger tapping, is one of the
    simplest tasks to study sensorimotor synchronization, which has been argued
    to capture the ability of coordinating one’s own movement with an external
    metronome89. In paced finger tapping, the asynchrony (the time difference
    between the response and the stimulus) is the fundamental variable of
    interest90, both for isochronous and for perturbed sequences91
* supp fig 12 A succinct illustration of the task used in the study is provided
* We tested two conditions: tapping in sync or out of sync with the stimuli

### Foreperiod paradigm and implicit timing

* implicit extraction of temporal regularities from the environment
  * allows people to form temporal predictions and orient attention 92
  * can lead to more efficient behaviour, such as faster response times or
    improved perceptual sensitivity93,94. Here we implemented an implicit
* we, fig 15, varied the foreperiod (the time interval between the cue and the
  target tone), such that the duration was either fixed (hence predictable) or
  variable (non-predictable) throughout a block, and we measured response times
  as an index of efficient temporal prediction

### Delay discounting

* ie the devaluation of the reward amount as a function of delay 95
* both the amount and the proximity of the reward important factors when
  participants are asked to choose between two options
* Some individuals may prefer the immediate reward over a delayed reward
  even when the amount offered immediately is substantially less
* Confinement typically leads to boredom, which can trigger impulsivity96. In
* we, fig 17, different amounts were offered to the participants at different
  delays to estimate the subjective values of the offers as a function of time
  required to collect them. The amounts for each country were adjusted
  according to the purchasing power parities (OECD data)

### Self-preference

* Phenomenological approaches have related time with self 98
* psychiatrists link time with disorders of the self in psychosis99,100,101
  * experimentally102,103
  * In addition to the PQ-16 questionnaire exploring attenuated psychosis
  * self-preference: an objective self-related measure
* a stimulus we associate with ourselves is processed faster and with higher
  accuracy than a stimulus we associate with others104,105
  * can be accounted for either by a self-referent memory advantage106 or by
    enhanced attention drawn to self-related information107
* we used a reaction time task in which the participants learn to associate a
  geometrical shape with a label (‘Self’, ‘Friend’ and ‘Other’; Supplementary
  Fig. 18). On subsequent trials, the participants are presented with one shape
  and one label, which may or not match the previously learned associations
  * The participants had to report as fast and as accurately as possible
    whether the shape and the label matched
