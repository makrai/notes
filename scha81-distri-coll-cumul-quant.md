# 1 Intro

* Theories which relate English sentences
  to logical formulas representing their truth conditions usually
  assume that
  * for every noun phrase in the surface structure there is
    a quantifier in the logical formula, and that
  * it depends on the determiner of the noun phrase what quantifier that is. The
* present paper points out some hitherto neglected phenomena which give rise to
  * significant departures from this approach.
  1. plural noun phrases with "the"
    Unless they are combined with "collective verbs", like "gather" or
    "disperse", such noun phrase are commonly taken to
    indicate universal quantification over the extension of the noun
    * Woods (1979), Bartsch (1973), Hausser (1974), Bennett (1975),
      Kroch (1979), Cushing (1977), Van Lehn (1978), Barwise & Cooper (1981).1
    * this is not adequate, if we consider the
      combination of two plural noun phrases with "the" with transitive
1a The squares contain the circles 
1b Every circle is contained in some square.  
2a The sides of rectangle 1 run parallel to the sides of rectangle 2.  
2b Every side of rectangle 1 runs parallel to some side of rectangle 2
    and every side of retangle 2 runs parallel to some side of retangle 1.
3a The sides of rectangle 1 cross the sides of rectangle 2.
3b Some sides of rectangle 1 cross some sides of rectangle 2.
* The present paper describes a treatment of quantification which accounts for
  this variety of readings (see especially Section 5). This treatment
  * abolishes the dichotomy between distributive and collective verbs that is
    usually assumed (cf. Hausser, 1974; Bennett, 1975). It shows that
  * deriving distributive readings from collective ones
    by means of meaning postulates, first introduced by Bartsch (1973), can be

* cumulative quantification (cf. Scha, 1978)
  * sentences with indefinite noun phrases may have readings which
    cannot be represented with a formula which has one quantifier for every NP -
  * Section 7 discusses this phenomenon that has been ignored so far:
(4a) 600 Dutch firms use 5000 American computers.
(4b) The total number of Dutch firms that use an American computer is 600 and
  the total number of American computers used by a Dutch firm is 5000.
* In order to generate cumulative readings, our grammar translate an NP sequence
  into one single quantifier, ranging over the cartesian product of the exts
* A grammar, which displays all the details of our treatment of quantif; Sec 8
  * in the framework of Universal Grammar (Montague, 1970): it specifies
* Some limitations of our grammar should be mentioned at the outset.
  * we have restricted ourselves to extensional verbs.
    (See Montague, 1973, for a treatment of intensional verbs)
  * We also ignore intensional readings of noun phrases, such as generics
  * Mass terms, negation, tense, coordinated noun phrases, embedded noun phrases
    and topic/focus problems are ignored as well.
* the first part of the paper (Section 2) introduces a new logical language
  * an extensional logical language to represent the truth conditions of the
  * involves some semantic notions which are not incorporated in the predicate
    calculus, the λ-calculus, or in languages such as Montague's Intensional
    Logic. 
  * has a rather rich type system
    * It allows variables ranging over η-tuples or sets, for example.
