# Abstract

* we review studies that deploy ... tools from probability and information theo
  * from the lexicon through syntax. These studies show how a pervasive

# Why Do Languages Look the Way they Do?

* cross-linguistic universals
* Chomsky (1975) de-emphasized efficiency of use as a source for similarities
  * because of the existence of ambiguity at all levels of linguistic structure
* information-theoretic analyses have shown that [ ambiguity is ] not a problem
  in language use, because context usually disambiguates (Piantadosi 2012)
* organization
  * we first define efficiency and other concepts from information theory that
  * we review the evidence that [ ambiguity ] is actually an argument for the
    information-theoretic approach and not against it
  * communicative efficiency must often be balanced against the complexity and
    learnability of languages. While
    * it is often possible to formulate these other constraints in
      information-theoretic terms (e.g., [17]),
      it remains to be seen whether this is possible in all cases. Finally, we
  * challenges for the efficiency/learnability framework

# What is Communicative Efficiency? 3

* source coding: choosing a code that makes signals short on average, according
  to the distribution over messages coming out of the information source, is
* channel coding: choosing a code to enable communication in the presence of
  noise, according to the characteristics of the channel
  * listener [may not be able to] perceive all the words the speaker says, or
    the speaker may be making speech errors, or
    the listener may not be paying full attention: these and all phenomena that
* Shannon (1948, 1949) has seen wide application in fields related to cognitive
  science, including
  * theoretical neuroscience [19]

# The Existence of Ambiguity Out of Context 5

* context resolves all communicatively relevant ambiguity [26]
  (even for children learning their native language [27]), and
  * in natural conversation the participants can easily query each other to [28]
* ambiguity becomes a communicatively desirable feature of language: by leaving
  out information inferrable from context, we can speak more concisely. This
  * proven rigorously in information theory [14] and can be appreciated
  * intuitively by looking at places where we attempt to communicate with zero
    ambiguity, such as legal contracts and computer programming languages

# Evidence of Communicative Efficiency in Human Language

## Word Length

* Zipf [29]: more frequent words tends to be shorter (e.g., ‘the’)
* In an optimal code, the length of a signal will depend on its probability in
  context, not its overall frequency
  30. Witten, I.H.+ (1987) Arithmetic coding for data compression
  * words that tend to be predicted by context should be even shorter
  * shown in a variety of languages (Piantadosi 2011)
  * information-theoretically efficient shortening processes in production
    choice was demonstrated by Mahowald+ [33]

  * kinship relations (e.g., [34,35]), color [36,37],
