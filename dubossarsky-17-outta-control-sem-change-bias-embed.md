# Abstract

* This article evaluates three proposed laws of semantic change
  * the proposed negative correlation between meaning change and word frequency
    is shown to be largely an artefact of the models of word reprs used;
  * the proposed negative correlation between meaning change and
    prototypicality is shown to be much weaker than what has been claimed
  * the proposed positive correlation between meaning change and polysemy is
    largely an artefact of word frequency
* analytical proofs that show that
  count representations introduce an inherent dependence on word frequency, and
  => word frequency cannot be evaluated as an indep factor with these reprs
