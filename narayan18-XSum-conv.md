# Abstract

* We introduce “extreme summarization”, a new single-document summarization task
  * not favor extractive strategies and calls for an abstractive modeling
  * one-sentence news summary: “What is the article about?”
  * real-world, large-scale dataset by
    online articles from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
* novel abstractive model which is conditioned on the article’s topics and
  based entirely on convolutional neural networks
* captures long-range dependencies in a document and recognizes pertinent contnt
* outperforming an oracle extractive system and SOTA abstractive approaches when
  evaluated automatically and by humans
