# 1 Intro

* Psychological adaptation to isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE)
  environments is a multifaceted field of research (Kanas & Manzey, 2008)
  * four large groups of characteristics thereof (Palinkas 2003):
    seasonal, situational, social and salutogenic. The
  * main factors involve the length of isolation, occurrence of significant
    events, contact with outsiders, weather; and experience (i.e., whether they
    are novices or veterans, Steel and Suedfeld (1991)
  * individual personality characteristics and adequate coping strategies also
    play an important role
    Palinkas, Suedfeld, and Steel (1995) argue that
  * emotional stability, psychological well-being, which includes
    mood and morale, anxiety, depression, aggression, hostility, life
    satisfaction, positive psychological outcomes, etc
  * Settings, crew sizes, and methodologies of emotionality assessment have
    also varied broadly (for a summary, see Palinkas & Suedfeld, 2008)

## 1.1. Patterns of emotionality in ICE environments

* overall decline of mood in the middle or in the second half of the isolation
  (Bechtel & Ledbetter, 1976).  found that
  * sleep difficulties, bad mood, and irritability were considerably higher
    during the mid-winter period (Gunderson and Nelson 1963)  suggested a
  * three-stage model (Rohrer 1961)
  * Gunderson (1973) also found three distinct phases
* In an early empirical study in Antarctica, Palmai (1963) divided a one-year
  period into four segments and found that “The third-quarter saw some further
  decline in morale, reflected also in irritability of the more responsible
  members” (p. 265)
  * Earls (1969) also described a four-quarter general adjustment pattern in
    submarine crews
* In 1991, Bechtel and Berning coined the term “third-quarter phenomenon,”
  though, originally only “for the sake of convenience” (p. 261)
  * In empirical support of the model were Harrison & Connors, 1984, Stuster,
    Bachelard, & Suedfeld, 2000, Sandal, 2000, and Décamps & Rosnet, 2005
  * However, Steel and Suedfeld found no evidence of this pattern of
    emotionality (Steel, 2001; Steel & Suedfeld, 1991)

## 1.2. Content analysis in the investigation of groups in ICE

* psychological content analysis
* verbal behavior may reflect psychological states and processes decodable by
  linguistic markers
* an established method in polar and space research.  One line of research is
* analysis of crew communication with Mission Control and the
  * interpersonal and individual psychodynamics within the crew in both
    ground-based simulations and space settings (for
  * review: Gushin+ (2016)
* thematic analysis of space personnel memoirs and crew diaries
  (Suedfeld & Weiszbeck, 2004; Suedfeld, 2006;
  Johnson, Asmaro, Suedfeld, & Gushin, 2012). Another approach,
* word-based content analysis, was applied to
  daily diaries of the members of a two-week mission located
  in the Mars Desert Research Station, USA (Ehmann+ 2011)
