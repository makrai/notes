A conceptual parser for natural language
Roger C. Schank and Lawrence G. Tesler
1969

* bears some similarity to the work of Quillian [but] intended to function as a
  more complete linguistic system. Thus, a grammar of a language is employed.
* The grammar of the system [has two parts]
  1. universal grammar exemplified by the conceptual rules
  2. language-specific
    * made up of realization rules 
      * intended to map pieces of the conceptual network into linguistic items
      * may be used for both parsing and generating

#3 Underlying theory

* For each type of dependency, semantic categories (such as `animate` object,
  human `institution` , `animal motion`) are delimited with respect to the
  conceptual category of a given concept, and defining characteristics are
  inserted when they are known. For example, concepts in the semantic category
  `physical object` all have the characteristic `shape`.  Sometimes this
  information is intrinsic to the particular concept involved, for example,
  'balls are round'.
* hierarchical structures
* The system of semantic categories and a method of constructing semantic files
  is discussed more fully in a previous paper
