# 1. Introduction

* estimating time depth by counting cognates in test vocabularies
  * interest the reconstruction of prehistory
  * linguistics itself,
    * tendency of vocabulary to change at a uniform rate
    * thus far:
      * lexical elements which are least subject to cultural influences,
      * partial study of only 13 control languages
* further analysis of the old word lists, and utilize the many criticisms and
  suggestions coming from colleagues in publications, discussion and
  correspondence.

# 2. The method

* a certain meaning is intended
* the common, everyday equivalent is listed for each language.
* lists for the two languages are then set parallel and scored for cognates
* define divergence as `st`, that is average _degree of separation_ multiplied by time,

# 3. Accuracy

* The main effort in the present paper is with respect to the diagnostic list.
  Certain changes are attempted and their effect on accuracy quantitatively
  evaluated

# 4. The test vocabulary

* items for a test list must be universal and non-cultural... Moreover, they
  must be easily identifiable broad concepts, which can be matched with
  simple terms in most languages."  These criteria, recognized from the first
  in lexicostatistic research, were not consistently followed
* negative features to be avoided: potential duplication (noted by Douglas
  Taylor), identical roots, sound imitation, semantic shading.

## 4.1. Universality p5

* we now drop the words ice, snow, freeze, snake, sea.
* contrary suggestion has been to develop variants of the test list for
  different large areas of the world

## 4.2. Cultural implications

* of the passage of time. It was at first thought that some culture concepts,
  artifacts and activities were so ancient and so widespread as to exempt them
  from the general defect of culture terms, and the following were therefore
  included in the old list (first revision): father, mother, husband, wife,
  spear, rope, stab (pierce), sew, hunt, play, fight. However, practically
  all of these items are unsatisfactory for other reasons
  * Numerals
    * tie-up between numbers and the patterns of commerce and technology.
    * languages said to lack numbers above two or which use compounds for three
      and over. The
    * new word list retains include such terms as leg, back, guts, whose
      reference is fairly inclusive and shades with one and two but drops the
      others.
  * salt, a trade article; flower and fruit, since cultured varieties present
    something culturally new; ice, strictly a manufactured article in some
    areas.
    * One of the characteristics of culture terms is [that] they may be
      borrowed along with the objects
  * animal species

## 4.3. Simplicity

## 4.4. Interlingual ambiguity and semantic shading

* cut, pull, dig, squeeze
  * it is frequently hard to match them in given languages, and
  * they belong to a distinctly lower level of stability
* also interlingually ambiguous and unstable object words. Even body parts
  include such terms as leg, back, guts, whose reference is fairly inclusive
  and shades with one and two but drops the others.  that of other words. The
  leg includes the foot, ankle, calf, shin, knee, thigh. Many languages have a
  single word for foot and leg. Others make a distinction between the lower and
  upper

## 4.5. Potential duplication

* synonymous.
  * In comparing two languages both of which have wife identical with woman,

## 4.6. Identical roots p7

## 4 7. Sound imitation

* . Baby-words, including those for father and mother (like pa, papa, dad...)

## 4.8. Form words [function words]

# 5. Item persistence

* elements [not] having approximately the same likelihood to persist
* the new list seems to offer considerable promise for rectifying much if not
  all of the skewing of the old one.
* Once we have an accurate measure of the skewing, the effect could be
  incorporated into the time depth equation

# 6. Control procedure p9

6.1. Overlapping histories [of languages]
6.2. Hidden divergence
  * We cannot be sure that Coptic is a lineal descendant of Middle Egyptian.
6.3. Time depth weighting
6.4. Dating of samples
6.5. Scoring
  * subjectivism ... in scoring cognates
6.6. Modifying factors
  * influence of possible factors other than time itself.

# 7. Provisional evaluation
