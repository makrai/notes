## 3.3 Abstract case

## 3.4 Semantic roles and grammatical relations 85

* a small, universal set
  * Since the late 1960s a number of theories
  * semantic relationships borne by nominal dependents to their governors
    make up a small, universal set
  * Theories ... include
    * Fillmore’s proposal for Case Grammar (1968, 1971),
    * John Anderson’s Localist Case Grammar (1971, 1977, 1997),
    * Starosta’s Lexicase (1971, 1988) and Dik’s Functional Grammar (1978)

### 3.4.4 Localist Case Grammar

* three characteristics of Localist Case Grammar that account for [how the
  larger number of semantic roles recognised by scholars] can be accommodated
  1. Localism
  * syntactic case categories [are] extensions of local case categories
    into an abstract domain
    e.g. the subject of [ _have_ ] in _She has it_ ... will be [locative].
  1. Syntagmatic contrast
    The absolutive and the locative are interpreted as goal (destination)
    in the context of ergative and ablative respectively.
    For instance, the noun phrase the stick will be [abs] both in
    _The stick broke_ and in _The teacher broke the stick_, but
    will be interpreted as a ‘goal of action’ ( patient) only in the transitive
  1. Multiple assignment
    * an argument can bear more than one case relation
* a desire to maintain a fixed mapping of extralinguistic roles to case[s]
  e.g. ‘teacher’ as [abl]
  since the ‘teacher’ is the abstract source of the knowledge
* holds roles constant under paraphrase
  * capturing the objective properties of the arguments and at the same time
    recognising the difference in perspective
  * e.g. tying the holistic reading to the case relation [abs]
* the core grammar of all languages is organised on an absolutive–ergative bas
