Deep Multilingual Correlation for Improved Word Embeddings
NAACL 2015

# Abstract

* Adding multilingual context when learning embeddings can improve their
  quality, for example via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on embeddings
  from two languages.
* In this paper, we extend this idea to learn deep non-linear transformations
  of word embeddings of the two languages,
  * using the recently proposed deep canonical correlation analysis. The
  * evaluated on multiple word and bigram similarity tasks, consistently
    improve over monolingual embeddings and over
    embeddings transformed with linear CCA
