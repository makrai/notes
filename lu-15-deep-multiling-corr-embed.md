Deep Multilingual Correlation for Improved Word Embeddings
NAACL 2015

# Abstract

* Adding multilingual context when learning embeddings 
  can improve their quality
  via eg canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on embeddings from two languages
* we extend this idea to
  learn deep non-linear transformations of word embeddings of the two languages
  * using the recently proposed deep canonical correlation analysis
  * evaluated on multiple word and bigram similarity tasks,
    consistently improve over
    both monolingual embeddings and embeddings transformed with linear CCA
