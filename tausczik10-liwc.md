2010 Journal of Language and Social Psychology

# Abstract

* Empirical results ... including to show attentional focus, emotionality,
  social relationships, thinking styles, and individual differences

# Computerized Text Analysis: A Brief History

* earliest
  * Freud (1901) wrote about slips of the tongue
  * Rorschach and others (e.g., Holtzman, 1950; Rorschach, 1921)
  * McClelland and a generation of thematic apperception test (TAT) researchers
    (e.g., McClelland, 1979; Winter, 1998) found that the stories people told in
    response to drawings of people could provide important clues to their needs
    for affiliation, power, and achievement
  * trained raters read the transcripts of people’s descriptions and
    * tagged words or phrases that represented the dimensions
* Gottschalk & Gleser, 1969; Gottschalk, Gleser, Daniels, & Block, 1958
  * content-analysis method by which to track Freudian themes in text
  * patients to talk in a _stream of consciousness_ way into a tape recorder
  * anxiety (e.g., death, castration), hostility toward self or others, and
    various interpersonal and psychological topics
  * later used in the psychiatric diagnoses of cognitive impairments,
    alcohol abuse, brain damage, and mental disorders
  * Attempts [to a computer program have] modest correlations to the
    judge-based “gold standard” (e.g., Gottschalk & Bechtel, 1993)
* first general purpose computerized text analysis program in psychology was
  developed by Philip Stone and his colleagues
  * Rosenberg & Tucker, 1978; Stone, Dunphy, Smith, & Ogilvie, 1966
  * adapted McClelland’s need-based coding schemes to any openended text
  * General Inquirer
  * other programs like it (e.g., Hart’s, 1984, DICTION program; Martindale,
    1990) have proven valuable in distinguishing mental disorders, assessing
    personality dimensions, and evaluating speeches
* the physician Walter Weintraub (1981, 1989)
  * pronouns and articles
  * first-person singular pronouns [were] linked to ... depression

# The Development of LIWC and the Psychometrics of Words

* Pennebaker & Beall, (1986)
  * categories included the degree to which the stories were organized,
    coherent, personal, emotional, vivid, optimistic, and evidenced insight
  * findings:
    * even with in-depth training, judges do not agree with each other
    * rating essays by multiple judges is extremely slow and expensive; and
    * judges tend to get depressed when reading depressing stories
* Martha Francis and [Pennebaker began developing a] text analysis program

## The Logic and Development of LIWC

* LIWC program has [a] processing component and the dictionaries
* calculate the percentage of each LIWC category
* categories
  * positive and negative emotion
  * thinking styles ... self-reflection, and causal thinking
  * more than 80
* For all subjective categories, an initial selection of word candidates was
  gleaned from dictionaries, thesauruses, questionnaires, and lists made by
  research assistants. two rounds of ratings
  * initial LIWC judging took place between 1992 and 1994
  * significant [revision] in 1997 and again in 2007
  * For details ... see Pennebaker, Chung, Ireland, Gonzales, and Booth (2007)

## The Psychometrics of Word Usage

## Content Versus Style Words [function words]

* goal was to ... tap
  * both psychological processes and the [topic]
* content and [function] words [are] processed in the brain very
  differently (Miller, 1995)
* style words are [linked to] people’s social and psychological worlds
  * the reader [needs to know] who “I” and “you” refer to.  Where is “here”
  * referents that are shared by two people in a particular conversation
  * (cf. Chung & Pennebaker, 2007)
  * detect emotional and biological states, status, honesty

# The Social and Psychological Meaning of Words

* In this section, we give a brief discussion of psychological processes and a
  small set of related of language categories. The section concludes with a
  comprehensive summary of findings about the correlates of word categories
  from a large group of studies

## Attentional Focus: Pronouns and Verb Tense

* language use ... can tell us where they are attending
  * such as tracking people’s gaze
* content word categories ... death, sex, money, or friends will refer to them
* Function words, such as
  * personal pronouns
    * People who are experiencing physical or emotional pain ... use more
      first-person singular pronouns (e.g., Rude, Gortner, & Pennebaker, 2004)
    * teasing, interaction with sex ... men may focus more on the perpetrator
      of the event when they are the victim
    * first-person plural pronouns—“we,” “us,” and “our.”
      * can signal a sense of group identity, such as when couples
      * Royal We, such as when the [boss says] that "we need to analyze that"
        * by political figures ... in Pennebaker & Lay (2002)
    Rudoph Guiliani in Pennebaker & Lay, 2002)
  * tense of common verbs can tell us about the temporal focus of attention
    * positive [political] ads used more present and future tense verbs, and
      negative ads used more past tense verbs (Gunsch+ 2000)
    * recall an event that they had discussed with someone else [vs]
      undisclosed event
      * significant differences in the verb tense used ... (Pasupathi, 2007)
      * greater past tense in discussing a disclosed event and
        greater present tense in discussing an undisclosed event
      * could indicate increased psychological distance and
        a higher degree of resolution for disclosed events

## Emotionality: Positive and Negative Emotions

* Use of emotion words [as a measure] of immersion [belemerülés]
  * higher use of emotion words showed more immersion in the traumatic event,
    which led to increased experience of physical pain (Holmes+ 2007)
* cognitive complexity [thinking styles], and social awareness
  * emotion words were correlated
    * negatively with articles[, prepositions,] and relativity words
    * positively with pronoun use[, auxiliary verb use,] and negation use
      * All correlations are highly significant, p < .001

## Social Relationships

* status, whether a group is working well together, if someone is being
  deceptive, and the quality of a close relationship. Word choice provides
  information about person perception (Semin & Fiedler, 1988).  Certain
  language clues give away relationships. Pronouns reveal how an individual is
  referencing those in the interaction and outside of it. Word count explains
  who is dominating the conversation and how engaged they are in the
  conversation. Assents and positive emotion words measure levels of agreement

## Status, Dominance, and Social Hierarchy

* Higher-status individuals speak more often and freely make statements that
  involve others. Lower-status language is more self-focused and tentative
* first-person
  * plural correlated with higher rank (Sexton & Helmreich, 2000)
  * singular was a good predictor of lower status (Kacewicz, Pennebaker, Davis,
    Jeon, & Graesser, 2009). Leshed+
* Higher-ranked crew members asked fewer questions
* members of small groups are rated as being more involved and task focused by
  their teammates if they use more words (Hancock, Cosley, McLeod, & Gay 2007)

## Social Coordination and Group Processes

* More communication, more unity, and positive feedback may promote better
  group performance
* type of
  * first-person plural pronouns may be important, if “we” is being used
    * promote interdependence as in “we can do this;” it may
    * increase group cohesion if ... it is being used to indirectly assign
      tasks as it may lead to resentment
  * assents (e.g., agree, OK, yes) could signal increased group consensus
    * Later in a group task, assents may signal consensus,
    * early assents may indicate blind agreement by unmotivated group members
      (Leshed, Hancock, Cosley, McLeod, & Gay, 2007)

## Honesty and Deception

* Deceptive statements
  * moderately descriptive, distanced from self, and more negative. Newman+
  * more motion words (e.g., arrive, car, go), fewer exclusion words
* the people being deceived ... also changed their language
  * both used a higher total word count, less first-person singular, and more
    sense words
* complexity
  * Motion, exclusion, and sense words all indicate the degree to which an
    individual elaborated on the description of the scenario
  * Deceptive statements are balanced in descriptiveness because
    * enough description is required to convince the other person
    * too much information might reveal inaccuracies
  * non-naïve individuals assigned to be deceptive ... showed less diversity
  * Complexity may be reduced in deceptive speech because of the cognitive load

## Close Relationships

* first-person plural (“we”) has not been found to be related to higher
  relationship quality
* second-person pronouns was negatively related to relationship quality
  * more second person ... scored higher on measures of criticism and having an
    overinvolved emotional reaction ... hostility
  * heterosexual romantic partners

## Thinking Styles: Conjunctions, Nouns, Verbs, and Cognitive Mechanisms

* two components of reasoning: the extent to which someone
  * differentiates between multiple competing solutions
    * Exclusive words (e.g., but, without, exclude)
      * used at higher rates among people telling the truth (Newman+ 2003)
  * integrates among solutions (Tetlock, 1981)
    * conjunctions
      * important for creating a coherent narrative (Graesser+ 2004)
* complexity
  * Prepositions (e.g., to, with, above), cognitive mechanisms (e.g., cause,
    know, ought), and words greater than six letters are all also indicative
    * [in] journal articles, authors use more prepositions in the discussion
      than the introduction or abstract
* active process of reappraisal [újraértékelés] ... in describing a past event
  * two subcategories of cognitive mechanisms,
    * causal words (e.g., because, effect, hence) and
    * insight words (e.g., think, know, consider),
  * led to greater health improvements
* in recounting a personal story younger participants used more filler words
  compared with older participants
  * no difference [when] story based on a picture

## Individual Differences

* age
  * become less self-focused, refer more to the moment, and
  * do not decline in verbal complexity
  * insight words, future tense verbs, and exclusive words increased
  * both in studies of different individuals ... and of authors over time
  * counter to expectations,
    * attention to time is more present and future oriented, and
    * verbal complexity may increase or at least stay the same
      evidenced by insight words and exclusive words
* Sex differences in language use show that
  * women use more social words and references to others, and
  * men use more complex language
  * effect [of] use of swear words, feeling words, and present tense verbs
* big-five personality traits, extraversion
  * higher word count and fewer large words predicted extraversion
  * categories of complexity [were less frequent in] extraversion
  * Social and emotional language also differed with respect to extraversion;
    * more positive emotion, and less negative emotion. The
  * findings ... support traditional personality models

# Conclusion

* Newer text analysis will be able to analyze more complex language structure
  while retaining LIWC’s transparency
* Studies have begun to look at n-grams
* relevant social information can vary greatly between language and cultures
  (cf. Maass, Karasawa, Politi, & Suga, 2006)
  * politeness, formality, and social closeness
    * function words (Boroditsky, Schmidt, & Phillips, 2003)
