Building an Italian FrameNet through Semi-automatic Corpus Analysis

* novelty with respect to the original FrameNet is represented by the fact that
  * the creation and annotation of Lexical Units is strictly grounded in
    distributional information
    * statistical distribution of verbal subcategorization frames,
    * lexical and semantic preferences of each frame) automatically
    * acquired from a large, dependency-parsed corpus
* long-term goal [is to create a] lexicon for Italian similar to the original
  English FrameNet
* For the moment, we have developed a database of syntactic valences
  * an autonomous resource besides the FrameNet lexicon, of which we have
  * a beginning nucleus consisting of 791 annotated sentences

# 1 Goals and Method

* semantic frames (Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore, 1985) –
  * schematic representations of the situations [of] human experience, each
  * participants in the situation, or Frame Elements (FEs) – and to describe
  * possible syntactic realizations of the FEs for every word (Fillmore+ 1992+)
  * focus ... is therefore on the syntactic-semantic interface
