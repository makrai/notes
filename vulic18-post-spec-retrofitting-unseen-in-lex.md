Post-Specialisation: Retrofitting Vectors of Words Unseen in Lexical Resources
naacl 2018

#Abstract

* Word vector specialisation (also known as retrofitting) is a 
  * portable, light-weight approach :-) ? to 
  * fine-tuning arbitrary distributional word vector spaces by 
  * injecting external knowledge from rich lexical resources such as WordNet.
  * only update the vectors of words occurring in external lexicons
* In this paper, ... constraint-driven vector space specialisation 
  * deep neural network ... to predict specialised vectors from their original
    * then used to specialise vectors of unseen words
* eval
  * intrinsic word similarity tasks
  * two downstream tasks: dialogue state tracking and lexical text simplification.
  * across three languages
