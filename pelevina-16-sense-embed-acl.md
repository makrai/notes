# Abstract

induce a sense inventory from existing word embeddings via clustering of
ego-networks of related words

# intro

* comparably to state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD systems

# 5.2

AdaGram sometimes outperforms our method, sometimes it is on par, depending on
the metric. We interpret these results as an indication of comparability of our
method to state-of-the-art approaches
