# 1. Introduction

* digital health is not a new or revolutionary one. For example, technologies,
  * eg medical images and telemedicine date back over 100 years (1, 2), while
  * prototype wearable devices have been used to tackle obesity since the 1940s
  * mid-1990s: the US National Academy of Medicine began recommending the
    complete digitization of health data (5), the transforming effects of
  * wearables and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, health care is moving
  * personalized and preventative paradigms utilizing ubiquitous technologies
    which support real-time self-care or monitoring (6).
* The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increases the need
  * virtual consultation technologies (7). Similarly, tools are needed to help
    understand and support the effects of the pandemic on our physical and, in
    particular, mental health (8). Even without this amplified need, it is

  and contagious virus diseases. By highlighting these challenges, Frontiers in

# 5. Role of Artificial Intelligence

* improved diagnosis, selecting treatments, and predicting clinical outcomes.
* challenges: safety, explainability, and fairness (42)
  * safety, AI systems are held to higher perceived safety standards than
    humans (43); ie, it is less acceptable for AI to make errors. Moreover, the
    risk to human life of AI-based systems is, currently, not well-studied, and
    * lack of standards for the verification and validation of such systems.
  * generalization issues associated with AI models
  * A recent systematic review of deep learning solutions in medical images
    * only a minimal number of studies in this field were of sufficient quality
      for clinical implementation (44).
* With GDPR in the European Union
  * clinicians and patients have a right to understand AI decisions (45). The
  * benefits
    * improving trust and transparency in AI systems for clinicians & patients
    * increased knowledge and understanding into internal operations and
      * improve the overall accuracy and generalizability of the enhanced
  * for deployment in clinical settings, the next generation of AI technologies
    needs to be transparent, understandable, explainable, and fair.
* AI already having achieved remarkable results in a range of health-based
  detection tasks
  * hE increasing explainability is a highly non-trivial task. This difficulty
