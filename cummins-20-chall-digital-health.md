# 1. Introduction

* digital health is not new or revolutionary
  * eg medical images and telemedicine date back over 100 years (1, 2)
  * prototype wearable devices have been used to tackle obesity since the 1940s
  * mid-1990s: the US National Academy of Medicine began recommending the
    complete digitization of health data (5)
  * wearables and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices for health care
  * personalized and preventative paradigms utilizing ubiquitous technologies
    which support real-time self-care or monitoring (6)
* coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increases the need
  * virtual consultation technologies (7)
  * Tools are needed to help understand and support the effects of the pandemic
    on our physical and mental health (8)
* Building on Kostkova (2015)
  * list
    * Multi-disciplinary Digital Health
    * Big Data and Public Health
    * MedTech
    * Self-Management
    * and Personalized Care
    * mHealth and Global Health Interventions
    * Evidence and Knowledge: Semantics
    * Social Media
    * and Persuasion
    * Serious Health Games and Games-Based Learning and Training
    * and Personal and Population Data—To Share or Not to Share? were
  * still very much at the forefront of digital health research
* new concerns, with a focus on the role of digital health concerning COVID-19
  and contagious virus diseases

# 5. Role of Artificial Intelligence

* improved diagnosis, selecting treatments, and predicting clinical outcomes
* challenges: safety, explainability, and fairness (42)
  * safety, AI systems are held to higher perceived safety standards than
    humans (43); ie, it is less acceptable for AI to make errors
    * the risk to human life of AI-based systems is not well-studied
    * lack of standards for the verification and validation of such systems
  * generalization issues associated with AI models
  * A recent systematic review of deep learning solutions in medical images
    * only a minimal number of studies in this field were of sufficient quality
      for clinical implementation (44)
* With GDPR in the European Union
  * clinicians and patients have a right to understand AI decisions (45)
  * benefits
    * improving trust and transparency in AI systems for clinicians & patients
    * increased knowledge and understanding into internal operations and
      * improve the overall accuracy and generalizability
  * for deployment in clinical settings, the next generation of AI technologies
    needs to be transparent, understandable, explainable, and fair
* AI already having achieved remarkable results in a range of health-based
  detection tasks
  * hE increasing explainability is a highly non-trivial task
