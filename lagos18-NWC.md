#3. A historical overview of word classes

* The parts of speech in the Tékhnē grammatikē were based solely on
  * morphology ... and semantics — syntactic behaviour was not taken into consi

#4.2.1. Hengeveld’s definition and classification

* In his functional theory of parts of speech, Hengeveld delineates four
  cross-linguistically valid functional slots that words can occupy, based on
  two binary parameters that encode the opposition between 
  * predicative and referential phrases and between 
  * heads and modifiers within these phrases
* criteria a/b
  for each function/word class there is exactly one word class/function [such
  that the words] can be used in that function without any additional marking,
* languages sorted into ... groups either
  * a & b, a -b, -a b
* Flexible languages satisfy (a) but not (b)
  * Turkish, for example, allows unmarked ...  “Non-verb” [N A Adv]
  * Tongan [N V, VS]]
* Rigid languages, on the other hand, obey (b) but not (a)
  * there are functional slots which cannot be filled by any unmarked [word]
  * Krongo, in which the “modifier in a referential phrase” function can only
    be represented by a relative clause construction 

#6. Word class shift

##6.1. Conversion

* conversion [is] the occurrence of a word without morphological
  differentiation in morphosyntactic environments that are associated with a
  different word class than the one it has originally been assigned to.
* problems in handling conversion as zero-derivation, namely the “extremely
  challenging feature” of directionality
* “partial conversion,” [is when a lexeme] occurs outside of the distribution
  of the word class it is normally associated with, but appears to not entirely
  take on the prototypical categorial features of any other major word class
