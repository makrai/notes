Geometric Methods for Context Sensitive Distributional Semantics
McGregor, Stephen
2017 PhD

# Abstract

* the work presented here explores a range of techniques for the selection of
  subspaces of word co-occurrence dimensions based on a statistical analysis of
  input terms as observed within large-scale textual corpora. The relationships
  between word-vectors that emerge in the projected subspaces can be analysed
  in terms of a mapping between their geometric features and their semantic
  properties. The power of this modelling technique is its ability to generate
  ad hoc semantic relationships in response to an extemporaneous linguistic or
  conceptual situation
