# Abstract

* we comparing Mongolian and Chinese speakers’ color perception. In this study,
* a free sorting task and a visual search task comparing Mongolian and Chinese
  * an Altay language
* both universal and relativistic forces are at play
* Chinese (Mandarin) and Mongolian color terms divide the
  blue spectrum differently but the green spectrum, similarly. In
  * Mongolian, light blue (“qinker”) and dark blue (“huhe”) are strictly
    distinct, while both light green and dark green are described as one word,
  * In Chinese, however,
    both light blue and dark blue are simply described by one word, lan, and
    both light green and dark green are described by a single word, lv. The
* free-sorting task, compared with Chinese speakers, Mongolian speakers
  exhibited different sorting in the blue region (by distinguishing light and
  dark blue) and the same sorting in the green region.  Further results showed
* visual search
  * Mongolian speakers discriminated visual search displays that fall into
    different linguistic categories in Mongolian (eg qinker or huhe) more
    quickly than visual search displays that belong to the same linguistic
    category (eg both qinker) in a visual search task. Moreover, this effect
    * disrupted in Mongolian participants who performed a secondary task
      engaging involving verbal working memory (but not a task engaging
      involving spatial working memory), suggested linguistic interference.
  * Chinese (Mandarin) speakers performing the visual search task did not show
    such a category advantage under any of the conditions.
* both Chinese and Mongolian speakers reacted faster to the green color than
  the blue color in the visual search task, suggesting that the variation in
  human color perception is constrained by certain universal forces. The
