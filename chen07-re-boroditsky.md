# Abstract

* English uses the horizontal spatial metaphors to express time (eg days ahead)
* Chinese also uses the vertical metaphors
  (eg, ‘the month above’ to mean last month)
* Do Chinese speakers, then, think about time in a different way than English
* Boroditsky (2001) claimed that they do: ‘language is a powerful tool in
  shaping habitual thought about abstract domains’ (such as time)
* we 
  * estimating the frequency of usage, we found that
    * Chinese speakers actually use the horizontal spatial metaphors more often
    * no logical ground for Boroditsky’s claim
  * unable to replicate her experiments in four different attempts. We
  * conclude that Chinese speakers do not think about time in a different way
