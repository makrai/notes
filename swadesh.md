# Versions and authors

* Swadesh himself created several versions of his list
  * started (1950) with a list of 225 meanings, which he
  * reduced to 165 words for the Salish-Spokane-Kalispel language
  * 1952 he published a list of 215 meanings,[2] of which he
  * suggested the removal of 16 for being unclear or not universal, with
    one added to arrive at 200 words
  * In 1955[3] he wrote, "The only solution appears to be a drastic weeding out
    of the list, in the realization that quality is at least as important as
    quantity....Even the new list has defects, but they are relatively mild and
    few in number
  * final 100-word list in 1971[4] and 1972
    * minor corrections
  * Explanations of the terms can be found in
    * Swadesh 1952[2] or,
    * where noted by a dagger (â€ ), in Swadesh 1955

  * Robert Lees (1953)

  * The CLLD-Concepticon collects various concept lists (including classical
    Swadesh lists) across different linguistic areas and times, currently
    listing more than 150 different concept lists. [5]
* Frequently used, not for any proven quality, but for its _electronic
  availability_ via the internet, is the version by I Dyen (1992, 200 meanings
  of 95 language variants)
  * Since 2010, a team around M Dunn has tried to update and enhance that list
