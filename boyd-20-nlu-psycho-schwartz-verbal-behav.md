# Abstract

* language has been used to infer psychological processes
* critical need for language analysis practitioners in the social sciences

# The Secrets of Verbal Behavior: From the Mystical to the Statistical

* early days of psychology
  * language was ascribed a vague, almost supernatural power to reveal the
    bubbling cauldron of the preconscious (Freud, 1915; Laffal, 1964). As the
  * Allport (1942) aired significant concerns about the need for more rigorous
    theory-testing in language analysis studies, rejecting much
* In the 1960’s, the so-called General Inquirer showed incredible promise
  * widespread technological optimism of early Space Age social sciences (eg
    Kranz, 1970; Stone+ 1962): a massive computer with software that
    could “read” texts and deduce the inner workings of the human mind
  * score texts for psychosocial phenomena, it was
  * hoped to remove subjectivity, bias, and human error from the measurement
  * aspired to become a standardized, scientific tool: something of a language
  * Early demonstrations showcased the system’s sheer potential: research
    * suicide notes to political documents to folktales highlighted the range
      (Colby+ 1963; Holsti, 1965)
  * hE it was complicated, difficult to maintain, and costly (Psathas, 1969)
    * “gold standard” of hand-scored texts (Smith, 1968)
  * Other approaches absorbed important lessons from the General Inquirer, and
    * greater statistical analyses of words over subjective readings (see, for)
      (Martindale & Martindale, 1988; Thomas & Duszynski, 1985; Wilson, 2006)
    * a newer, more scientific rationale for language analysis
      as a psycho research method

## LIWC: Little Words, Big Secrets

* charting a client’s trajectory through treatment by how often the concepts of
  “hope” or “social alienation” are mentioned (Gottschalk & Gleser, 1969)
* skimming over the small, “meaningless” parts of language—words like “the”
  * eg+ gaining versus losing power?  actively or passively?  certainty?
  Following the rise and fall of the General Inquirer, the idea that language
  may reveal hidden, esoteric clues about human psychology began taking on new
  forms. By the late 20th century, researchers were learning that the
* “particles” of language could provide remarkably powerful insights into a
  * pronouns (I, you, we), articles (the, a, an), and negations (no, not)
  * reliable indicators of a how a person thinks, regardless of what they were
    talking about (Pennebaker, 2011; Weintraub, 1989)
  * Some of the most important verbal behavioral markers of a person’s psycho,
* truly user-friendly text analysis software—in particular, LIWC
  * objective, automated, and transparent psychological text analysis a
  * widespread personal computing and, for the first time in scientific
    * the typical social scientist could now perform serious, objective,
* principle: word frequencies represent attentional habits (Stone+ 1966;
  Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)
  * People who use high rates of articles and prepositions tend to focus on
    formal or concrete concepts and their inter-relations (Pennebaker+ 2014)
  * People with higher social status and confidence are more focused on the
    external social environment than themselves, using more “you” and “royal
    we” words than “I” words (Kacewicz+ 2014)
  * the dominant rationale in the language analysis world. Indeed,
  * much of our current understanding about the relationship between verbal
    behavior and psychology has been scaffolded by the relatively simplistic
    method of LIWC that is “word counting.” At its core, the word counting
  * categories that are informed by psychological theory:
    * emotion words (happy, upset, angry), agentic words (do, able, try),
      thinking words (think, understand, guess), self-referential words (I, me)
  * never intended as a model of language itself
    * Rather grounded in psychometric theory and the statistical analysis of
    * ie empirical principles of the entirety of psychological science
  * never believed that the lists are comprehensive, semantically cohesive, or
    even particularly well-suited to the task of estimating “sentiment.”
  * fuzzy indicators of other, more interesting latent psychological phenomena
* [the concepts] were fundamentally different from those of classical
  psychoanalysis. Now, the mysteries contained within people’s words were
  * effable and calculable, but more subtle and statistical
  * too small to see with the naked eye, but discernible using computerized
  * a direct pipeline into their
    * personalities (Boyd & Pennebaker, 2017),
    * life experiences (Chung & Pennebaker, 2018),
    * cultures (Michel+ 2011), and
    * societies (Iliev+ 2016)

# The Attentional View of Verbal Behavior

* words correspond to attentional focus—as the norm
  * Today, the majority of language analysis theory assumes that
  * word frequencies reflect the relative amount of attention a person pays to
* Other conceptualizations of language approach verbal behavior as
  * tapping into the degree or orientation of dimensional psychological procs,
  * typologies that reflect psychodynamic “modes” of thinking, or even
  * stages of psychosocial development
  * (Bucci & Maskit, 2006; Conway+ 2020; Lanning+ 2018)

## The Merits of “Words as Attention”

* eg personality
  * social attention is the defining feature of extraversion (Ashton+ 2002). If
  * extraverts use more “social” words (Mairesse+ 2007)
* an incredible number of topics. Over the years
  * a strong nomological network—one that describes the correlations between
    various psychological processes and attentional patterns—has been woven
  * eg when describing their homes tell us whether they are focused on the
    relaxing or stressful properties of their abodes (Saxbe & Repetti, 2010)
  * psychologists who focus on their social connections live longer (Pressman &
    Cohen, 2007), and that
  * students who focus (perhaps a bit too much) on eating, drinking, and sex
    tend to fare worse in university (Robinson+ 2013). Word frequencies tell us
  * how much attention two people pay to each other (Ireland & Pennebaker 2010)
  * one’s attention to various facets of the self (Rodríguez-Arauz+ 2017)
* One of the greatest strengths: extensibility into otherwise difficult areas
  * “cognitive” words: problem-solving and stress, (D’Andrea+ 2012)
    * estimate a person’s stress levels simply by counting their words
  * This basic “validation–extension” research cycle has expanded language
  * across virtually every domain of scientific research, including
    * public health (Eichstaedt+ 2015), politics (Jordan+ 2018),
      neuropsychology (Lumma+ 2018), affect (Garcia & Rimé, 2019), personality
      (Schwartz+ 2013), and genetics (Mehl+ 2017). Even in the absence of other
  * facilitates meaningful theory-testing, ranging from the study of
    * daylight cycles on mood (Golder & Macy, 2011) to
    * personality-driven business outcomes (Block+ 2019)

## The Pitfalls of “Words as Attention”

1. limited material with which to meaningfully expand our nomological network
   * constrains the very types of empirical questions that can be probed
2. too simple a model of language, one that was never designed (or intended) to
   accommodate the full complexity and functionality of verbal behavior

## Overwhelmingly Descriptive Research

* The majority of validation efforts have been geared toward demonstrating that
  * convergent validity with other conceptualizations of the same measures
    (eg self-reports, behaviors, etc.)
  * in domains like well-being (Vine+ 2020), social status (Kacewicz+ 2014),
    values (Bardi+ 2008)
* an overly complicated and meaningless network of intercorrelations with
  little-to-no theoretical value (Meehl, 1990)
* not explanatory of those same phenomena (McCrae & Costa, 1995)
  * lacking: tease apart the antecedents, facets, and consequences of anger,
  * most studies simply use verbal behavior as a presumed measure of anger
* eg “anger” has several hypothesized appraisal tendencies associated with it:
  externalization, control, and certainty (Lerner & Keltner, 2000).
  * An experimental condition that induces anger, then, might explore verbal
    behavior to determine the degree to which a person uses more
    * “you” and “they” words (reflecting greater externalization),
    * agentic words (reflecting greater control), and
    * absolutist words (reflecting greater certainty)
  * ~> the deeper meaning, purpose, and utility of language is preserved and
    informs broader psychological theory rather than being reduced
* decoupling a literal, one-dimensional interpretation of the relationship
  between words and anger, we return to a more intuitive place for language

## Isn’t Language Supposed to be... You Know... Social?

* we overlook the fundamental essence of language itself: to transmit and
  coordinate complex information (broadly defined) with others
* traditionally downplayed due to the sheer difficulty of collecting and
  analyzing language data from two or more people; until very recently,
* “split the difference,” so to speak, by analyzing the language of mass media
  such as newspapers, speeches by political leaders, or other sociocultural
  artifacts as a proxy for group psychology (Hogenraad, 2003; Robinson+ 2017)
* Even in the context of studying rich online spaces designed around soc, most
  language analysis studies profile each group member separately
  * as agents operating within a complete social vacuum
* studies that directly explore language as complex, bidirectional social
  * Language analysis techniques such as Language Style Matching (LSM) and
    Latent Semantic Similarity (LSS) are currently thought to give us a “broad
    strokes” picture of interpersonal attention, eg Ta+ (2017)
  * still primarily rooted in the idea of “words as attention”
  * when and how much two people are paying attention to each other
    (Bayram & Ta, 2019; Doorn & Müller-Frommeyer, 2020; Heuer+ 2020)
    * social interaction implies interpersonal attention, and
      the degree to which people are focused on each other is foundational
  * the attentional processes captured by LSM (see Gasiorek+ 2021) and LSS
  * Attentional patterns are necessary, but not sufficient, to explain the
  * motivations and goals during social interact (Berger, 2014; Horowitz+ 2006)
* social cognitive domains, such as the “why’s” and “how’s” of deception,
  persuasion, and person perception as they occur through verbal behavior
  * persuasion has begun to thrive, with scholars starting to leverage language
    * how social appraisals are shaped by subtle linguistic cues
      (Althoff+ 2014; Markowitz, 2019)
    * how personality is inferred through lang (Berry+ 1997; Tong+ 2020)
* group identification and interpersonal motives
  (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil+ 2013; Niculae+ 2015)

# The Future of Language Analysis in Psychology

## Increasingly Faithful Models of Human Psychology Through Verbal Behavior

* ambiguity
  * _play_
  * Rouhizadeh+ (2016) showed that the psychological meaning of pronouns can
    reverse depending on the discourse context. In this work, the
    * well-established relationships between first-person pronouns and gender,
      age, and depression changed substantially depending on how they were
    * females used somewhat more first-person singulars (I, me, my) than males,
      males were more likely to use first-persons in the context of physical
      attack verbs (hit, kick, strike). Despite the fact that self-referential
      language is one of the more robust linguistic correlates of depression
      (Holtzman+ 2010), Rouhizadeh+ (2016) compellingly showed that not all
      self-references are equal
* nested contexts
* Looking at words under the “words as attention” paradigm
  * a decontextualized understanding of the word, thus yielding
  * an ambiguous psychosocial sense (Markowitz & Hancock, 2019)
  * needed: a “words in context as attention” approach, whereby
  * features of the individual themselves are implicitly folded into the
    quantification of their words and what they reflect (Garten+ 2019)

## Embeddings and Beyond

* latent semantic indexing (Deerwester+ 1990), which is still in use today.6
  * a fuzzy representation of an entire text’s meaning (eg a diary entry)
  * calculate the similarity of a document’s meaning to important concepts
  * such as “happiness” or “fairness” (Garten+ 2018)
* contextual embeddings: at least one level of context: discourse. In essence,
  * a more stable approach to move beyond function words, mapping a nearly
* how social concepts are represented in word embedding models (Bolukbasi+
  2016; Caliskan+ 2017). Similarly, the changing social landscape
* rapid increase of research into stereotypes, prejudices, and biases as they
  are formulated, embedded, and surreptitiously transmitted in our language
  (Carpenter+ 2017; Snefjella+ 2018). We are excited to see what can be learned

## Greater Interdisciplinarity

* necessary: interdisciplinary cooperation not just in the conduct of research,
  but also in the creation of new paradigms that facilitate the rapid and
* merits of interdisciplinary collaboration (Cummings & Kiesler, 2016)

## The Bird in Borrowed Feathers: Computational social science?

* social scientists have gradually become more computationally savvy =hozzáértő
  * computer scientists have begun to recognize the need for better theoretical
    models of human behavior
    * beyond a purely “informatic” view of social psychology (Wang+ 2007)
* an explosion of research at the intersection: “computational social science”
* In practice hE “computational social science” ~= intelligent data pipelines
  * use one type of human-generated data (eg text or videos) to
  * predict another (eg scores on questionnaires; behaviors), often providing
  * no real test of social theories or insights into human psychology
  * machine learning exercises masquerading as social science
  * social scientists haphazardly wielding [véletlenszerűen hadonászva]
    powerful machine learning algorithms and poorly-validated language models,
    deriving statistically flawed interpretations of their data
  * computer scientist butchering basic theories of human behavior
  * psychologist excitedly proclaiming that “big data” and “machine learning”
    solved their research problems with unbelievable accuracy
  * each field has its own sci norms (ie paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense):
    * fitting psychological theory into the norms of machine learning or vice
      versa = square peg into a round hole
* The way forward: developing new paradigms in computational social science
  * Initial steps: practical guides written within specific disciplines that
    outline other fields and norms
    * eg political science papers describing computational text analysis
      (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013);
    * psychology papers describing machine learning (Stachl+ 2020), and
    * machine learning papers describing social sciences (O’Connor+ 2011)
