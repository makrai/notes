# Abstract

* existing detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their
  applicability in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, 
* we propose an annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs)
  to generate a sarcasm dataset. 
  * Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ 
  * GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by 
    human verification to resolve disagreements. 
* We validate this approach by comparing annotation quality and detection
  performance 
  on a publicly available sarcasm dataset using a 
  collaborative gating architecture.
* we introduce PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through
  * 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset’s potential as a benchmark
