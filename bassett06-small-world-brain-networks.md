#Mathematical Concepts

* To evaluate the properties of a real-life network, these parameters must be
  compared to the mean clustering coefficient and path length estimated in a
  random graph with the same number of nodes, edges, and degree distribution
  as the network of interest. 
  * In a random [Watts and Strogatz] graph, the 
    * average minimum path length is typically short, L rand ∼ ln N/ln([K/N] – 1), and the 
    * average clustering coefficient is typically small, C rand ∼ (K/N)/N
  * For a small-world network, by definition, we expect the ratio 
    * λ = L/L rand to be approximately 1 and the ratio 
    * γ = C/C rand to be greater than 1.  Therefore, a 
    * simple scalar measure of small worldness can be defined as σ = γ/λ, which
      * greater than 1 if the network [is small-worldn] 
        (Humphries and others 2006).
* More recent methodological work has developed alternative metrics of complex
  networks that can be related to C and L and may have some technical or con-
  ceptual advantages. For example, we can define the 
    * global efficiency of information transmission by a network 
    * local efficiency or fault tolerance of a network as 
      * proportional to the clustering coefficient, E loc ∼ C
    * measure of cost. One simple
      * sum of edges between regions in the graph (Latora and Marchiori 2003); a
      * costly network will have many edges. 
  * high global and local efficiency at relatively low cost 
    (Latora and Marchiori 2003)
    * Many small-world networks in biology and sociology have been shown to
      have [this] economic property
