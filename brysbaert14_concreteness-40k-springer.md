Concreteness ratings for 40 thousand generally known English word lemmas
Behav Res (2014) 46:904–911

#Abstract 

* Concreteness ratings are presented for 37,058 English words and 2,896 2-word
  expressions (such as zebra crossing and zoom in), 
  obtained from over 4,000 participants by means of a norming study using Turk
* Although the instructions stressed that [ concreteness would be based on ]
  all senses and motor responses, 
  a comparison with the existing concreteness norms indicates that
  participants, as before, largely focused on visual and haptic [tapintási]

#Intro

* Concreteness evaluates the degree to which the concept denoted by a word
  refers to a perceptible entity. The variable came to the foreground in
  * Paivio’s dual-coding theory (Paivio, 1971, 2013). According to this theory,
    * concrete words are easier to remember than abstract words, 
      because they activate perceptual memory codes in addition to verbal
  * context availability theory (Schwanenflugel, Harnishfeger, and Stowe 1988)
    * concrete words are easier to process 
      because they are related to strongly supporting memory contexts, whereas
      abstract words are not, as can be demonstrated by asking people how easy
      it is to think of a context in which the word can be used.

The importance of concreteness for psycholinguistic and memory research is hard
to overestimate. A search through the most recent literature gives the
following, nonexhaustive list of topics related to concreteness. Are there
hemispheric differences in the processing of concrete and abstract words
(Oliveira, Perea, Ladera, & Gamito, 2013)? What are the effects of word
concreteness in working memory (Mate,

Allen, & Baqués, 2012; Nishiyama, 2013)? How are concrete and abstract concepts
stored in and retrieved from long-term memory (Hanley, Hunt, Steed, & Jackman,
2013; Kousta,

Vigliocco, Vinson, Andrews, & Del Campo, 2011; Paivio, 2013)? Does concreteness
affect bilingual and monolingual word processing (Barber, Otten, Kousta, &
Vigliocco, 2013;

Connell & Lynott, 2012; Gianico-Relyea & Altarriba, 2012;

Kaushanskaya & Rechtzigel, 2012)? Do concrete and abstract
words differ in affective connotation (Ferre, Guasch,

Moldovan, Sánchez-Casas, 2012; Kousta et al., 2011)? Do
neuropsychological patients differ in the comprehension of
concrete and abstract words (Loiselle et al., 2012)?

Concreteness gained extra interest within the embodied
view of cognition (Barsalou, 1999; Fischer & Zwaan, 2008;

Wilson, 2002)—in particular, when neuroscience established
that words referring to easily perceptible entities coactivate the
brain regions involved in the perception of those entities.

Similar findings were reported for action-related words, which
coactivate the motor cortex involved in executing the actions
(Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermüller, 2004). On the basis of
these findings, Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, and Garrett (2004;
see also Andrews, Vigliocco, & Vinson, 2009) presented a
semantic theory, according to which the meaning of concepts
depends on experiential and language-based connotations to
different degrees. Some words are mainly learned on the basisBehav Res (2014) 46:904–911
of direct experiences; others are mostly used in text and
discourse. To make the theory testable, Della Rosa,

Catricala, Vigliocco, and Cappa (2010) collected ratings of
mode of acquisition, in which participants were asked to
indicate to what extent the meaning of a word had been
acquired through experience or through language.

Unfortunately, to our knowledge these (Italian) norms have
not yet been used to predict performance in word-processing
tasks.

A final reason why concreteness has been a popular vari-
able in psychological research is the availability of norms for a
large number of words. Ratings were collected by Spreen and

Schulz (1966), Paivio (both in Paivio, Yuille, & Madigan,
1968, and in unpublished data) and made available in the

MRC database (Coltheart, 1981) for 4,292 words. The same
database provides imageability ratings (closely related to the
concreteness ratings) for 8,900 words. Throughout the years,
authors have collected additional concreteness or imageability
norms for specific subsets of words (e.g., Altarriba, Bauer, &

Benvenuto, 1999; Schock, Cortese, & Khanna, 2012;

Stadthagen-Gonzalez & Davis, 2006), which could be com-
bined with the MRC ratings.

Impressive though the existing data sets are, developments
in the past years have rendered them suboptimal. First, even 9,
000 words is a limited number when viewed in the light of
recently collected megastudies. For instance, the English

Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) contains processing times
for more than 40,000 words, and the British Lexicon Project
(Keuleers, Lacey, Rastle, & Brysbaert, 2012) has data for
more than 28,000 monosyllabic and disyllabic words. This
means that concreteness ratings are available only for limited
subsets of available behavioral data sets.

A second limitation of the existing concreteness ratings is
that they tend to focus too much on visual perception (Connell
& Lynott, 2012; Lynott & Connell, 2009, in press) at the
expense of the other senses and at the expense of action-
related experiences. Lynott and Connell (2009) asked partic-
ipant to what extent adjectives were experienced “by touch,"
"by hearing," "by seeing," "by smelling," and "by tasting"
(five different questions). Connell and Lynott observed that
these perceptual strength ratings were correlated only with
concreteness ratings for vision, touch, and, to a lesser extent,
smell. They were not correlated for taste and were even
negatively correlated for auditory experiences. Similarly, none
of the concreteness ratings collected so far includes the in-
struction that the actions one performs are experience based as
well (and hence, concrete).

To remedy the existing limitations, we decided to collect
new ratings for a large number of stimuli. This also allowed us
to address another enduring problem in word recognition
research—namely, the absence of a standard word list to refer
to. Individual researchers use different word lists for rating
studies and word recognition megastudies, mostly based on
905
existing word frequency lists. A problem with some of these
lists is that they contain many entries that, depending on the
purposes of one’s study, could qualify as noise. For instance, a
study by Kloumann, Danforth, Harris, Bliss, and Dodds
(2012) reported affective valence ratings for the 10,000 most
frequent entries attested in four corpora. Their list included
items that are unlikely to produce informative affective rat-
ings, such as spelling variants (bday, b-day, and birthday),
words with special characters (#music, #tcot), foreign words
not borrowed into English (cf. the Dutch words “hij” [he] and
“zijn” [to be]), alphanumeric strings (a3 and #p2), and names
of people, cities, and countries. The list also included inflected
word forms, which is a useful design option only if one
expects inflected forms to differ in rating from lemmas (e.g.,
runs vs. run). When we compared Kloumann et al.’s list to a
large list of English lemmas (see below), only half of the
stimuli overlapped (see also Warriner, Kuperman, &

Brysbaert, in press). This is a serious loss of investment,
which is likely to further increase for less frequent entries
(where the signal-to-noise ratio is even smaller).

To tackle the problem head on, we collected concreteness
ratings for a list of 63,039 English lemmas one of us (M.B.)
has been assembling over the years. This list does not contain
proper names or inflected forms. The latter are more difficult
to define in English than would be assumed at first sight,
because many inflected verb forms are homonymous (and
derivationally related) to uninflected adjectives (appalling)
or nouns (playing). The simplest criterion to disambiguate
such cases is to verify whether the word is used more often
as an adjective/noun than as a verb form. This has become
possible since we collected part-of-speech-dependent word
frequency measures for American English (Brysbaert, New,
& Keuleers, 2012). Similarly, some nouns are used more
frequently in plural form than in singular form (e.g., eyes) or
have different meanings in singular and plural (glasses ,
aliens). For these words, both forms were included in the list.

Finally, the list for the first time also includes frequently
encountered two-word spaced compound nouns (eye drops,
insect repellent, lawn mower) and phrasal verbs (give away,
give in, give up). The latter were based on unpublished
analyses of the SUBTLEX-US corpus (Brysbaert & New,
2009). By presenting the full list, we were able to see which
words are known to the majority of English speakers indepen-
dently of word frequency. One way often used to select words
for megastudies is to limit the words to those with frequencies
larger than one occurrence per million words (e.g., Ferrand
et al., 2010; Keuleers, Diependaele, & Brysbaert, 2010). This
is a reasonable criterion but may exclude generally known
words with low frequencies, which arguably are the most
interesting to study the limitations of the existing word fre-
quency measures.

In summary, we ran a new concreteness rating study (1) to
obtain concreteness ratings for a much larger sample of906

English words, (2) to obtain ratings based on all types of
experiences, and (3) to define a reference list of English
lemmas for future studies.
