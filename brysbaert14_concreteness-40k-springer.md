Concreteness ratings for 40 thousand generally known English word lemmas
Behav Res (2014) 46:904–911

# Abstract

* Concreteness ratings are presented for 37,058 English words and 2,896 2-word
  expressions (such as _zebra crossing_ and _zoom in_),
  obtained from over 4,000 participants by means of a norming study using Turk
* Although the instructions stressed that [concreteness would be based on]
  all senses [érzékek] and motor responses,
  a comparison with the existing concreteness norms indicates that
  participants, as before, largely focused on visual and haptic [tapintási]

# Intro

* Concreteness: the degree to which the entity is perceptible
  * Paivio’s dual-coding theory (Paivio, 1971, 2013)
    * concrete words are easier to remember than abstract words,
      because they activate perceptual memory codes in addition to verbal
  * context availability theory (Schwanenflugel, Harnishfeger, and Stowe 1988)
    * concrete words are easier to process
      because they are related to strongly supporting memory contexts, whereas
    * how easy it is to think of a context in which the word can be used
* topics related to concreteness
  * hemispheric differences in the processing (Oliveira+ 2013)
  * working memory (Mate, Allen, & Baqués, 12; Nishiyama, 13)
  * long-term memory
    (Hanley, Hunt, Steed, & Jackman, 2013; Kousta+ 2011; Paivio, 2013)
  * bilingual and monolingual word processing
    (Barber, Otten, Kousta, & Vigliocco, 2013; Connell & Lynott, 2012;
    Gianico-Relyea & Altarriba, 2012; Kaushanskaya & Rechtzigel, 2012)
  * affective connotation
    (Ferre, Guasch, Moldovan, Sánchez-Casas, 2012; Kousta+ 2011)
  * neuropsychological patients (Loiselle+ 2012)?
    * selective anterior temporal lobe resection and ... amygdalo-hippocampectm
  * within the embodied view of cognition
    (Barsalou, 1999; Fischer & Zwaan, 2008; Wilson, 2002)
    * words referring to easily perceptible entities coactivate the brain reg
    * action-related words, which coactivate the motor cortex involved
      (Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermüller, 2004)
    * semantic theory, according to which the
      (Andrews, Vigliocco, & Vinson, 2004;2009)
      * meaning of concepts [differ:] experiential vs language-based connot
        * the latter: mostly used in text and discourse
      * ratings of mode of acquisition
        (Della Rosa, Catricala, Vigliocco, and Cappa 2010)
* availability of norms
  * existing concreteness ratings ... tend to focus too much on visual
    (Connell & Lynott, 2012; Lynott & Connell, 2009, in press)
    at the expense of the other senses and ... action-related experiences
  * to what extent adjectives were experienced 
    by touch, hearing, seeing, smelling, and tasting (Lynott and Connell 2009)
    * perceptual strength ratings were correlated only with ... vision, touch,
      and, to a lesser extent, smell
  * none of the concreteness ratings [includes] experience based
* [rare words] could qualify as noise
* [our] list does not contain proper names or inflected forms
    * [some] inflected verb forms are homonymous (and derivationally related)
      to uninflected adjectives (appalling) or nouns (playing)
      * whether the word is used more often as an adjective/noun than as a verb
  * some nouns are used more frequently in plural form than in singular form
    (e.g., eyes) or have different meanings in singular and plural (glasses)
    * For these words, both forms were included in the list
  * two-word spaced compound nouns (eye drops, insect repellent, lawn mower)
  * phrasal verbs (give away, give in, give up)
    * presenting ... which words are known to the majority of English speakers
      independently of word frequency
