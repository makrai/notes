> This fact has tended to puzzle, displease, or delight philosophers

# 1 Intro

* a conditional sentence expresses a proposition which
  * is a function of two other propositions, yet
  * not a truth function of those propositions
  * eg I may know the truth values of
    "Willie Mays played in the American League" and
    "Willie Mays hit four hundred"
    without knowing whether or not
    Mays would have hit four hundred if he had played in the American League.
* This fact has given rise to a number of philosophical problems; I discuss 3 
  * the logical problem of conditionals, a problem that frequently is ignored or
    * describing the formal properties of the conditional function: a function,
    * represented in English by the words "if ... then", taking ordered pairs of
    * I explain informally and defend a solution, presented more rigor elsewhere
  * the pragmatic problem of counterfactuals
    * has dominated recent discussions of contrary-to-fact conditionals is
    * the formal properties of the conditional function, together with all of
      the facts, may not be sufficient for determining the truth value of a
    * ie different truth values of conditional statements may be consistent
      with a single valuation of all nonconditional statements. The task set by
    * find and defend criteria for choosing among these valuations.
    * pragmatic, and not semantic
      * The distinction hE depends on the construction of a semantic theory
      * The semantic theory that I shall defend will thus help by charting the
        boundary between the semantic and pragmatic components of the concept.
      * Rescher (1964) avoids this boundary line by couching his
        whole discussion in terms of conditions for belief, or justified belief,
        rather than truth
      * Conditions for justified belief are pragmatic for any concept. 2
  * an epistemological problem that has bothered empiricist philosophers. It is
    * many counterfactuals seem to be synthetic, and contingent, statements
      about unrealized possibilities
    * contingent statements must be capable of confirmation by empirical evid,
      and the investigator can gather evidence only in the actual world
    * How are conditionals which are both empirical and contrary-to-fact possib?
    * How do we learn about possible worlds, and
      where are the facts (or counterfacts) which make counterfactuals true?
    * philosophers to try to analyze the conditional in non-conditional terms 3
      to show that conditionals merely appear to be about unrealized possibilits
      * endnote; Chisholm (1946), 289-307,
        * The problem is sometimes posed (as it is here) as the task of
          analyzing the subjunctive conditional into an indicative statement,
        * it is a mistake to base very much on the distinction of mood. As far
        * the mood tends to indicate something about the attitude of the
          speaker, but in no way effects the propositional content
      * My approach, however, will be to accept the appearance as reality, and
        * one can sometimes have evidence about nonactual situations.  
* organization
  * In Sections II and III of this paper, I shall present and defend
    a theory of conditionals which has two parts,
    * a formal system with a primitive conditional connective, and
    * a semantical apparatus which provides general truth conditions for
      statements involving that connective
  * Sections IV, V, and VI, I shall discuss in a general way the relation 
    to the three problems outlined above.  

# II. The interpretation 2

* my hypothesis about the truth conditions for conditional statements
* begin by asking a more practical question: how does one evaluate a conditional
  * An answer to this question will not be a set of truth conditions, but it
    will serve as a heuristic aid in the search for such a set.  
* eg situation: you are faced with a true-false political opinion survey. The
  * "If the Chinese enter the Vietnam conflict,
    the United States will use nuclear weapons
  * How do you deliberate in choosing your response? What logical considerations
  * two familiar answers to this question, and then defend a third answer which
  1. based on the simplest account of the conditional, the truth functional anal
    * first, will the Chinese enter the conflict?  and
      second, will the United States use nuclear weapons?
    * If the answer to the first question is no,
      or if the answer to the second is yes, then => 'true' box. But this
    * unacceptable since the following piece of reasoning is an obvious non
      * for even an indicative conditional.
  2. a conditional affirms some sort of logical or causal connection
    * suggested by the shortcomings of the truth-functional account
      * The material implication analysis fails, critics have said, because it
        leaves out the idea of connection which is implicit in an if-then statem
    * If the hypothesis were accepted, then task; clarifying 'connection'
    * but there are counter-examples even with this notion left as obscure as it
    * eg you
      * firmly believe that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable because of
        the arrogance of power, the bellicosity of our president, rising
        pressure from congressional hawks, or other domestic causes. You
      * no opinion about future Chinese actions, but you do not think they will
      => you believe
        * the opinion survey statement to be true even though you believe the
        * antecedent and consequent to be logically and causually independent of
    * the presence of a 'connection' is not a necessary condition for the truth
  3. based on a suggestion made some time ago by Ramsey (1950) 
    * Consider first/2nd/3dr the case where
      * you have no opinion about the statement, "The Chinese will enter"
        * your deliberation about the survey statement should be a thought exper:
          add the antecedent to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs), and then
          consider whether or not the consequent is true.
        * Your belief about the conditional should be the same as your
          hypothetical belief, under this condition, about the consequent.
        * What happens to the idea of connection on this hypothesis?
          * It is some/other times relevant/not to the evaluation of a conditional
          * If you believe that a causal or logical connection exists, then you
            will add the consequent to your stock of beliefs along with the
            antecedent, since the rational man accepts the consequences of his
            beliefs. On the other hand,
          * if you already believe the consequent (even if believe it to be
            causally independent of the antecedent), then it will remain a part of
            your stock of beliefs when you add the antecedent, since the rational
            man does not change his beliefs without reason.
          * In either case, you will affirm the conditional. Thus this answer
            accounts for the relevance of 'connection' when it is relevant without
            making it a necessary condition of the truth of a conditional.
    * you believe or know the antecedent to be true; in this case,
      * no changes need be made in your stock of beliefs. If you already believe
      * your belief about the conditional will be just the same as your belief
        about the statement that the U.S. will use the bomb.
    * you know or believe the antecedent to be false? In this situation,
      * you cannot simply add it to your stock of beliefs
        without introducing a contradiction. You must
      * make adjustments by deleting or changing those beliefs which conflict
        with the antecedent
      * difficulties; there will be more than one way to make the adjustments
        * Rescher calls this the problem of the ambiguity of belief-contravening
          hypotheses.
          * the resolution of this ambiguity depends on pragmatic consideration.
            Cf, also Goodman's problem of relevant conditions in Goodman (1955)
        * These difficulties point to the pragmatic problem of counterfactuals,
          but if we set them aside for a moment, we shall see a rough but
          general answer to the question we are asking
* It is crucial, however, that the answer may not be restricted to some
  particular context of belief
  if it is to be helpful in finding a definition of the conditional
  * If the conditional is to be understood as a function of the
    propositions expressed by its component clauses, then
    its truth value should not in general be dependent on the attitudes
    which anyone has toward those propositions.
  * Now the problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth
    * believe condition: "How do we decide whether or not we believe a statement
    * to find a set of truth conditions for statements having conditional form
      which explains why we use the method we do use to evaluate them
* The concept of a possible world is just what we need to make this
  * the ontological analogue of a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following
  * first approximation to the account that I shall propose:
  * Consider a possible world in which A is true, and which otherwise differs
    minimally from the actual world. "If A, then B" is true (false) just in case
    B is true (false) in that possible world.
  * advantage of providing a ready made apparatus on which to build a formal
    semantical theory
* In making this account of the conditional precise, we use the semantical
  systems for modal logics developed by Saul Kripke (1963)
* first define a model structure. Let M be an ordered triple (K, R, \lambda).
  * K is to be understood intuitively as the set of all possible worlds;
  * R is the relation of relative possibility which defines the structure.
    If a and \beta are possible worlds (members of K), then
    a R \beta reads "\beta is possible with respect to a". This means that,
    where a is the actual world, \beta is a possible world
    R is a reflexive relation; that is, every world is possible with respect
    * you may add that R must be transitive, or transitive and symmetrical.?
      * endnote;
      * we build on is von Wright's M. If we add the
      * transitivity requirement => Lewis's S4
      * both the transitivity and symmetry requirements, then S5
  * \lambda
    * The only element that is not a part of the standard modal semantics is
    * a member of K which is to be understood as
      __the absurd world__ the world in which
      contradictions and all their consequences are true
  * \lambda is an isolated element under R; that is,
    no other world is possible with respect to it, and
    it is not possible with respect to any other world.
  * The purpose of A is to allow for an interpretation of "If A, then B" in the
    case where A is impossible; for this situation one needs an impossible
* selection function f In addition to a model structure
  * takes a proposition and a possible world as arguments and
    a possible world as its value
  * selects, for each antecedent A , a particular possible world in which A is
    true
  * The assertion which the conditional makes, then, is that the consequent is
    true in the world selected
  * A conditional is true in the actual world when its consequent is true in the
    selected world.
* `>` as the conditional connective
  A > B is true in a  if B is true in f(A, a); 
  A > B is false in a if B is false in f(A, a)
* conditional logic to be an extension of modal logic
  * Modal logic provides a way of talking about what is true in the actual
    world, in all possible worlds, or in at least one, unspecified world
  * The addition of
    the selection function to the semantics and
    the conditional connective to the object language of modal logic
    provides a way of talking also about what is true in particular non-actual
    possible situations
  * This is what counterfactuals are: statements about particular counterfactual
    worlds.
* The s-function must meet at least the following conditions. I shall use the
  * terminology for talking about the arguments and values of s-functions: where
    f(A, a) = \beta, 
  A is the antecedent, a is the base world, and \beta is the selected world.
  For all antecedents A and base worlds a,
  (1) A must be true in f(A, a).
  (2) f(A, a) = \lambda only if
              there is no world possible with respect to `a` in which A is true
* required that the world selected differ __minimally__ from the actual world. This
  * that does the least violence to the correct description and explanation of
    the actual world. These are vague conditions which are
    largely dependent on pragmatic considerations for their application.
* the selection is based on an ordering of possible worlds
  with respect to their resemblance to the base world. If this is correct,
  For all base worlds a and all,,,
  (3) antecedent `a`, if A is true in a, then f(A, a) = a.
  (4) antecedents B and B', if
    B is true in f(B', a) and
    B' is true inf(B, a),
    then f(B, a) = f(B', a)
    * ensures that the ordering among possible worlds is consistent 
      ie if any selection established \beta as prior to \beta' in the ordering,
      then no other selection (relative to that a) may establish \beta' as prior
      to \beta
    * If f(A, \alpha) = \beta, then \beta is prior to all worlds possible with
      respect to \alpha in which A is true.
  * Conditions (3) and (4) together ensure that
    the s-function establishes a total ordering of all selected worlds with
    respect to each possible world
* These conditions on the selection function don't determine the function unique
  * There may be further formal constraints that can plausibly be imposed on the
  * not expect to find semantic conditions sufficient to guarantee uniqueness
  * The questions ~ are reformulations of the pragmatic problem of
    * "On what basis do we select a selection function from among the acceptable
    * "What are the criteria for ordering possible worlds?" are .
    * a problem in the application of conditional logic
  * The conditions that I have mentioned above are sufficient, however, to
    define the semantical notions of validity and consequence for cond logic.

# III. The formal system 7

* a formal system, C2
  * The class of valid formulas of conditional logic according to the defs in
    the preceding section, is coextensive with the class of C2 theorems
  * primitive connectives of C2 are
    * the usual \supset and ~ (with v, &, and ≡ defined as usual), as well as
    * a conditional connective, > (called the corner).
  * Other modal and conditional concepts can be defmed in terms of the corner as

□A = ~A > A
⋄A = ~(A > ~A)
A ≷ B = (A > B) & (B > A)
* The rules of inference of C2 are
  * modus ponens (if A and A \supset B are theorems, then B is a theorem) and
  * the Gödel rule of necessitation (If A is a theorem, then □A is a theorem).
  * axiom schemata:
  (al) Any tautologous well-formed formula is an axiom.
  (a2) □(A \supset B) \supset (□A \supset □B)
  (a3) □(A \supset B)\supset (A > B)
  (a4) ⋄A \supset* (A > B)\supset~(A >~B) 
  (a5) A > (B v C) \supset (A > B) v (A > C)
  (a6) (A > B) \supset (A \supset B)
  (a7) A ≷ B \supset* (A > C) \supset (B > C)
* The conditional connective, as characterized by this formal system, 
  * inter mediate between strict implication and the material conditional,
    in the sense that
    □(A \supset B) entails A > B by (a3) and
    A > B entails A \supset B by (a6)
  * It cannot, however, be analyzed as a modal operation performed on a
    material conditional (like Burks (1951)'s causal implication, for example)
    * endnote: The causal implication connective characterized in this article
      has the same structure as strict implication.
    * For an interesting philosophical defense of this modal interpretation of
      conditionals, see Mayo (1957)
* The corner
  lacks certain properties shared by the two traditional implication concepts,
  * these differences help to explain some peculiarities of counterfactuals. I
  * three unusual features of the conditional connective.
  (1) Unlike both material and strict implication,
    the conditional corner is a non-transitive connective
    * That is, from A > B and B > C, one cannot infer A > C. While this may at
    * eg Premisses
        "If J. Edgar Hoover were today a communist, then he would be a traitor"
        [áruló]
        "If J. Edgar Hoover had been born a Russian, then he would today be a
        communist."
      Conclusion
        "If J. Edgar Hoover had been born a Russian, he would be a traitor." It
    * reasonable to affirm these premisses and deny the conclusion.
    * If this example is not sufficiently compelling, note that
      the following rule follows from the transitivity rule:
      From A > B to infer (A & C) > B.
      But the former rule is invalid; we cannot always strengthen the ante-
      cedent of a true conditional and have it remain true. 
      eg "If this match were struck, it would light," and
          "If this match had been soaked in water overnight and it were struck,
          it would light
    * endnote
      * a related inference is of course valid
      From A > B, B> C, and A, one can infer C
      * Also, note that the biconditional connective is transitive
        From A ~ B and B ~ C, one can infer A ~ C
      * Thus the biconditional is an equivalence relation, since it is also
        symmetrical and reflexive.
  (2) According to the formal system,
    the denial of a conditional is equivalent to
    a conditional with the same antecedent and opposite consequent
    (provide that the antecedent is not impossible)
    ie \diam A ~ (A > B) \eqviv (A > ~B).
    * explains the fact, noted by both Goodman and Chisholm that
      the normal way to contradict a counterfactual is to contradict the
      consequent, keeping the same antecedent
  (3) The inference of contraposition,
    valid for both the truth-functional horseshoe and the strict implication
    hook, is
    invalid for the conditional corner
    A > B may be true while ~B > ~A is false
    * take another item from the political opinion survey:
      "If the U.S. halts the bombing, then North Vietnam will not agree to
      negotiate."
      A person would believe that this statement is true if he thought that the
      North Vietnamese were determined to press for a complete withdrawal of
      U.S. troops.
      But he would surely deny the contrapositive, "If North Vietnam agrees to
      negotiate, then the U.s. will not have halted the bombing." 
      He would believe that halt in the bombing, and much more, is required to
      bring the North Vietnamese to the negotiating table
    * endnote; modus tolens is valid for the conditional:
      from A > B and ~B, one can infer ~A.
* Examples of these anomalies have been noted by philosophers in the past.  
  * Goodman pointed out (2) and (3). He accounted for these facts by arguing
  * semifactuals ~~ conditionals with false antecedents and true consequents ~~
    are for the most part not to be taken literally
  * "full counterfactuals affirm, while semifactuals deny, that a certain
    connection obtains between antecedent and consequent
    * The practical import of a semifactual is thus different from its literal
      import."
  * Chisholm also suggested paraphrasing semifactuals before analyzing them.
    "Even if you were to sleep all morning, you would be tired" is to be read
    "It is false that if you were to sleep all morning, you would not be
    tired."l3
  * A separate and nonconditional analysis for semifactuals is necessary to save
    the 'connection' theory of counterfactuals in the face of the anomalies we
* summ
  * The theory presented in Section II avoids this difficulty
    by denying that the conditional are, in general, to assert a connection of
  * It is the structure of inductive relations and causal connections which
    make counterfactuals and semifactuals true or false, but
  * determining the relationships among possible worlds, which in turn determine
    the truth values of conditionals
  * the relation between connection and conditionals is an indirect relation in
    this way
