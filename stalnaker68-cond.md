> This fact has tended to puzzle, displease, or delight philosophers

# 1 Intro

* a conditional sentence expresses a proposition which
  * a function of two other propositions, yet
  * not a truth function of those propositions
  * eg I may know the truth values of
    "Willie Mays played in the American League" and
    "Willie Mays hit four hundred"
    without knowing whether or not
    Mays would have hit four hundred if he had played in the American League
* This fact has given rise to a number of philosophical problems; I discuss 3
  1. the logical problem of conditionals, a problem that is frequently ignored
    * describing the formal properties of the conditional function
    * represented in English by the words "if ... then", taking ordered pairs
    * I explain informally and defend a solution, presented more rigor elsewhere
  1. the pragmatic problem of counterfactuals
    * dominated recent discussions of contrary-to-fact conditionals
    * the formal properties of the conditional function, together with all of
      the facts, may not be sufficient for determining the truth value
    * ie different truth values of conditional statements may be consistent
      with a single valuation of all nonconditional statements
    * find and defend criteria for choosing among these valuations
  * pragmatic, and not semantic
    * The distinction hE depends on the construction of a semantic theory
    * The semantic theory that I shall defend will thus help by charting the
      boundary between the semantic and pragmatic components of the concept
    * Rescher (1964) avoids this boundary line by couching his whole discussion
      in terms of conditions for belief, or justified belief, rather than truth
    * Conditions for justified belief are pragmatic for any concept
  1. an epistemological problem that has bothered empiricist philosophers
    * many counterfactuals are synthetic and contingent statements about
      unrealized possibilities
    * contingent statements must be capable of confirmation by empirical evid,
      and the investigator can gather evidence only in the actual world
    * How are conditionals which are both empirical and contrary-to-fact possib?
    * How do we learn about possible worlds, and
      where are the facts (or counterfacts) which make counterfactuals true?
    * philosophers tried to analyze the conditional in non-conditional terms
      to show that conditionals are merely about unrealized possibilities
      * endnote; Chisholm (1946)
        * The problem is sometimes posed (as it is here) as the task of
          analyzing the subjunctive conditional into an indicative statement,
        * it is a mistake to base very much on the distinction of mood
        * the mood tends to indicate something about the attitude of the
          speaker, but in no way effects the propositional content
      * My approach, however, will be to accept the appearance as reality
        * one can sometimes have evidence about nonactual situations
* organization
  * In Sections II and III of this paper, a theory of conditionals
    * two parts,
      * a formal system with a primitive conditional connective, and
      * a semantical apparatus which provides general truth conditions for
        statements involving that connective
  * Sections IV, V, and VI discuss the relation to the three problems above

# II. The interpretation 2

* my hypothesis about the truth conditions for conditional statements
* begin by asking a more practical question: how does one evaluate a conditional
  * An answer to this question will not be a set of truth conditions, but
    a heuristic aid in the search for such a set
* eg situation: you are faced with a true-false political opinion survey
  * "If the Chinese enter the Vietnam conflict,
    the United States will use nuclear weapons
  * How do you deliberate in choosing your response? What logical considerations
  * two familiar answers to this question, and then defend a third answer
  1. the simplest account of the conditional, the truth functional analysis
    * first, will the Chinese enter the conflict?  and
      second, will the United States use nuclear weapons?
    * If the answer to the first question is no,
      or if the answer to the second is yes, then => 'true' box
    * unacceptable for even an indicative conditional
  2. a conditional affirms some sort of logical or causal connection
    * suggested by the shortcomings of the truth-functional account
      * The material implication analysis fails, critics have said, because it
        leaves out the idea of connection which is implicit in an if-then statem
    * clarifying 'connection'
    * but there are counter-examples even with this notion left obscure
    * eg you
      * firmly believe that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable because of
        the arrogance of power, the bellicosity of our president, rising
        pressure from congressional hawks, or other domestic causes
      * no opinion about future Chinese actions, but you do not think they will
      => you believe
        * the opinion survey statement to be true even though you believe the
          antecedent and consequent to be logically and causually independent
    * the presence of a 'connection' is not a necessary condition for the truth
  3. based on a suggestion made by Ramsey (1950)
    * Consider first/2nd/3dr the case where
    * you have no opinion about the statement, "The Chinese will enter"
      * your deliberation about the survey statement should be a thought exper:
        add the antecedent to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs), and then
        consider whether or not the consequent is true
      * Your belief about the conditional := your
        hypothetical belief, under this condition, about the consequent
      * What happens to the idea of connection on this hypothesis?
        * It is some/other times relevant/not to the evaluation of a conditional
        * If you believe that a causal or logical connection exists, then you
          will add the consequent to your stock of beliefs along with the
          antecedent, since the rational man accepts the consequences of his
          beliefs
        * if you already believe the consequent (even if believe it to be
          causally independent of the antecedent), then it will remain a part of
          your stock of beliefs when you add the antecedent,
          since the rational man does not change his beliefs without reason
        * In either case, you will affirm the conditional
        * this answer accounts for the relevance of 'connection' when it is
          relevant
          without making it a necessary condition of the truth of a conditional
    * you believe or know the antecedent to be true; in this case,
      * no changes need be made in your stock of beliefs
      * your belief about the conditional := your belief about the consequent
    * you know or believe the antecedent to be false? In this situation,
      * you cannot simply add it to your stock of beliefs
        without introducing a contradiction
      * You must make adjustments by
        deleting or changing those beliefs which conflict with the antecedent
      * difficulties; there will be more than one way to make the adjustments
        * Rescher calls this the problem of
          the ambiguity of belief-contravening hypotheses
          * the resolution of this ambiguity depends on pragmatic consideration
          * Cf, also Goodman's problem of relevant conditions in Goodman (1955)
        * These difficulties point to the pragmatic problem of counterfactuals,
          but if we set them aside for a moment, we shall see a rough but
          general answer to the question we are asking
* It is crucial, however, that the answer may not be restricted to some
  particular context of belief
  if it is to be helpful in finding a definition of the conditional
  * If the conditional is to be understood as a function of the
    propositions expressed by its component clauses, then
    its truth value should _not_ in general be _dependent on the attitudes_
    which anyone has toward those propositions
  * Now the problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth
    * believe condition:= How do we decide whether or not we believe a statement
    * to find a set of truth conditions for statements having conditional form
      which explains why we use the method we do use to evaluate them
* The concept of a possible world is just what we need
  * the ontological analogue of a stock of hypothetical beliefs
  * first approximation to the account that I shall propose:
  * Consider a possible world in which A is true, and which otherwise differs
    minimally from the actual world
    * "If A, then B" is true (false) := B is true (false) in that possible world
  * advantage: a ready made apparatus on which to build a formal semant theory
* In making this account of the conditional precise, we use the semantical
  systems for modal logics developed by Saul Kripke (1963)
* first define a model structure. Let M be an ordered triple (K, R, \lambda)
  * K is to be understood intuitively as the set of all possible worlds;
  * R is the relation of __relative possibility__ which defines the structure
    * If a and \beta are possible worlds (members of K), then
      a R \beta reads "\beta is possible with respect to a"
      * where a is the actual world, \beta is a possible world
      * R is a reflexive relation
    * you may add that R must be transitive, or transitive and symmetrical
      * we build on von Wright's M
      * transitivity requirement => Lewis's S4
      * both the transitivity and symmetry requirements, then S5
  * \lambda
    * The only element that is not a part of the standard modal semantics
    * a member of K which is to be understood as
      __the absurd world__, the world in which
      contradictions and all their consequences are true
  * \lambda is an isolated element under R; that is,
    no other world is possible with respect to it, and
    it is not possible with respect to any other world
  * The purpose of A is to allow for an interpretation of "If A, then B" in the
    case where A is impossible
* selection function f In addition to a model structure
  * takes a proposition and a possible world as arguments and
    a possible world as its value
  * selects, for each antecedent A, a particular possible world in which A is
    true
  * The assertion which the conditional makes, then, is that the consequent is
    true in the world selected
  * A conditional is true in the actual world when its consequent is true in the
    selected world
* `>` as the conditional connective
  A > B is true in a  if B is true in f(A, a);
  A > B is false in a if B is false in f(A, a)
* conditional logic to be an extension of modal logic
  * Modal logic provides a way of talking about what is true in the actual
    world, in all possible worlds, or in at least one, unspecified world
  * The addition of
    the selection function to the semantics and
    the conditional connective to the object language of modal logic
    provides a way of talking also about what is true in particular non-actual
    possible situations
  * This is what counterfactuals are: statements about particular counterfactual
    worlds
* The s-function must meet at least the following conditions
  * terminology for talking about the arguments and values of s-functions: where
    f(A, a) = \beta,
  A is the antecedent, `a` is the base world, and \beta is the selected world
  * For all antecedents A and base worlds a,
  (1) A must be true in f(A, a)
  (2) f(A, a) = \lambda only if
              there is no world possible with respect to `a` in which A is true
* required that the world selected differ __minimally__ from the actual world
  * that does the least violence to the correct description and explanation of
    the actual world. These are vague conditions which are
    largely dependent on pragmatic considerations for their application
* the selection is based on an ordering of possible worlds
  with respect to their resemblance to the base world. If this is correct,
  For all base worlds a and all,,,
  (3) antecedent `a`, if A is true in a, then f(A, a) = a
  (4) antecedents B and B', if
    B is true in f(B', a) and
    B' is true inf(B, a),
    then f(B, a) = f(B', a)
    * ensures that the ordering among possible worlds is consistent
      ie if any selection established \beta as prior to \beta' in the ordering,
      then no other selection (relative to that a) may establish \beta' as prior
      to \beta
    * If f(A, \alpha) = \beta, then \beta is prior to all worlds possible with
      respect to \alpha in which A is true
  * Conditions (3) and (4) together ensure that
    the s-function establishes a total ordering of all selected worlds with
    respect to each possible world
* These conditions on the selection function don't determine the function unique
  * There may be further formal constraints that can plausibly be imposed
  * don't expect to find semantic conditions sufficient to guarantee uniqueness
  * The questions ~ are reformulations of the pragmatic problem of counterfactls
    * On what basis do we select a selection function
    * What are the criteria for ordering possible worlds?
    * a problem in the application of conditional logic
  * The conditions that I have mentioned above are sufficient, however, to
    define the semantical notions of validity and consequence for cond logic

# III. The formal system 7

* a formal system, C2
  * The class of valid formulas of conditional logic according to the defs in
    the preceding section, is coextensive with the class of C2 theorems
  * primitive connectives of C2 are
    * the usual \supset and ~ (with v, &, and ≡ defined as usual), as well as
    * a conditional connective, > (called the corner)
  * Other modal and conditional concepts can be defined in terms of the corner
  □A = ~A > A     [necessary]
  ⋄A = ~(A > ~A)  [possible]
  A ≷ B = (A > B) & (B > A)
* The rules of inference of C2 are
  * modus ponens (if A and A \supset B are theorems, then B is a theorem)
  * the Gödel rule of necessitation (If A is a theorem, then □A is a theorem)
  * axiom schemata:
  (a1) Any tautologous well-formed formula is an axiom
  (a2) □(A \supset B) \supset (□A \supset □B)
  (a3) □(A \supset B) \supset (A > B)
  (a4) ⋄A \supset \cdot (A > B) \supset ~(A >~B)
  (a5) A > (B v C) \supset (A > B) v (A > C)
  (a6) (A > B) \supset (A \supset B)
  (a7) A ≷ B \supset \cdot (A > C) \supset (B > C)
* The conditional connective, as characterized by this formal system,
  * intermediate between __strict implication__ & the __material conditional__
    in the sense that
    □(A \supset B) entails A > B by (a3) and
    A > B entails A \supset B by (a6)
  * It cannot, however, be analyzed as a modal operation performed on a
    material conditional (like Burks (1951)'s causal implication, for example)
    * endnote: The causal implication connective characterized in this article
      has the same structure as strict implication
    * For an interesting philosophical defense of this modal interpretation of
      conditionals, see Mayo (1957)
* The corner
  lacks certain properties shared by the two traditional implication concepts,
  * these differences help to explain some peculiarities of counterfactuals
  * three unusual features of the conditional connective
  1. Unlike both material and strict implication,
    the conditional corner is a non-transitive connective
    * That is, from A > B and B > C, one cannot infer A > C
    * eg Premisses
        "If J. Edgar Hoover were today a communist, then he would be a traitor"
        [áruló]
        "If J. Edgar Hoover had been born a Russian, then he would today be a
        communist."
      Conclusion
        "If J. Edgar Hoover had been born a Russian, he would be a traitor."
      * reasonable to affirm these premisses and deny the conclusion
    * If this example is not sufficiently compelling, note that
      the following rule follows from the transitivity rule:
      From A > B to infer (A & C) > B
      * But the former rule is invalid; we cannot always strengthen the
        antecedent of a true conditional and have it remain true
      * eg "If this match were struck, it would light," and
          "If this match had been soaked in water overnight and it were struck,
          it would light
    * endnote
      * a related inference is of course valid
      From A > B, B > C, and A, one can infer C
      * Also, note that the biconditional connective is transitive
        From A ~ B and B ~ C, one can infer A ~ C
      * Thus the biconditional is an equivalence relation, since it is also
        symmetrical and reflexive
  2. According to the formal system,
    the denial of a conditional is equivalent to
    a conditional with the same antecedent and opposite consequent
    (provide that the antecedent is not impossible)
    ie ⋄A -- ~(A > B) ≡ (A > ~B)
    * explains the fact, noted by both Goodman and Chisholm that
      the normal way to contradict a counterfactual is to contradict the
      consequent, keeping the same antecedent
  3. The inference of contraposition,
    valid for both the truth-functional \supset and the strict implication
    ->, is
    invalid for the conditional corner
    A > B may be true while ~B > ~A is false
    * take another item from the political opinion survey:
      "If the U.S. halts the bombing, then North Vietnam will not agree to
      negotiate."
      A person would believe that this statement is true if he thought that the
      North Vietnamese were determined to press for a complete withdrawal of
      U.S. troops
      * ie the consequent is determined
      * But he would surely deny the contrapositive, "If North Vietnam agrees to
      negotiate, then the U.S. will not have halted the bombing."
    * He would believe that halt in the bombing, and much more, is required to
      bring the North Vietnamese to the negotiating table
    * endnote; modus tolens is valid for the conditional:
      from A > B and ~B, one can infer ~A
* Examples of these anomalies have been noted by philosophers
  * Goodman pointed out (2) and (3)
  * semifactuals ~~ conditionals with false antecedents and true consequents ~~
    are for the most part not to be taken literally
  * semifactuals deny, that a certain connection obtains between antece & conseq
    * The practical import of a semifactual is different from its literal import
  * Chisholm also suggested paraphrasing semifactuals before analyzing them
    * "Even if you were to sleep all morning, you would be tired" is to be read
    * "It is false that if you were to sleep all morning, you would not be
      tired"
  * A separate and nonconditional analysis for semifactuals is necessary to save
    the 'connection' theory of counterfactuals in the face of the anomalies
* summ
  * The theory presented in Section II avoids this difficulty
    by denying that the conditional are, in general, to assert a connection
  * It is the structure of inductive relations and causal connections which
    make counterfactuals and semifactuals true or false
  * determining the relationships among possible worlds, which in turn determine
    the truth values of conditionals
  * the relation between connection and conditionals is an indirect relation in
    this way

# IV. The logical problem: general considerations 10

* The traditional strategy for a problem like the logical problem of conditional
* show that the unclear or objectionable phrase was dispensable, or
  replaceable by something clear and harmless
* Analysis
  * unpacking making manifest of what was latent in the concept or
  * replacement of a vague idea by a precise one,
    adequate to the same purposes as the old expression, but problem-free
* The semantic theory of conditionals can also be viewed either as ~ or ~
  * construction of a concept to replace an unclear notion of ordinary language,
  * explanation of a commonly used concept
  * I see the theory in the latter way (no recommendation or stipulation)
* hE the theory is not a description of linguistic usage
* explain the structure of a concept
* Linguistic facts what we would say in this or that context, and what
  sounds odd to the native speaker are relevant as evidence
* concepts are to some extent mirrored in language
* The 'facts', taken singly, need not be decisive [döntő]
* A recalcitrant [makacs] counter-example may be judged
  a deviant use or a different sense of the word
  * a paraphrase is necessary,
* or even that ordinary language is systematically mistaken about the
    concept we are explaining
* such ad hoc hypotheses and qualifications diminish both the plausibility
   and the explanatory force of a theory
* While we are not irrevocably bound to the linguistic facts, there are no
  'don't cares' contexts of use with which we are not concerned, since any
  context can be relevant as evidence for or against an analysis
* A general interpretation which
    avoids dividing senses and
    accounts for the behavior of a concept in many contexts
    fits the familiar pattern of scientific explanation in which
    diverse, seemingly unlike surface phenomena are seen as
    deriving from some common source
=> I take it as a strong point in favor of the semantic theory that
  it treats the conditional as a univocal concept

# V. Pragmatic ambiguity 11

* I have argued that the conditional connective is semantically unambiguous
* It is obvious, however, that the context of utterance, the
  purpose of the assertion, and the beliefs of the speaker or his community may
  make a difference to the interpretation of a counterfactual
* the notion of ambiguity
  * A sentence is ambiguous if there is more than one proposition which it may
    properly be interpreted to express
  * Ambiguity may be
    * syntactic (more than one grammatical structure)
    * semantic (if one of the words has more than one meaning), or
    * pragmatic (if the interpretation depends directly on the context of use)
      * probably the most common in natural languages
      * Any sentence involving pronouns, tensed verbs, articles or quantifiers
        is pragmatically ambiguous
        * eg the truth conditions for "All's well that ends well" depends on the
          domain of discourse
      * we may add conditional sentences to this list
        * depend on the specification of an s-function
* The grounds for treating the ambiguity of conditional sentences as pragmatic
  rather than semantic are
  * the same as the grounds for treating the ambiguity of quantified sentences
    as pragmatic
  * simplicity and systematic coherence
  * The truth conditions for quantified statements vary with a change in the
    domain of discourse, but
    there is a single structure to these truth conditions which remains
    constant for every domain
  * The semantics for classical predicate logic brings out this common structure
    by giving the universal quantifier a single meaning and making
    the domain a parameter of the interpretation
  * In a similar fashion, the semantics for conditional logic brings out the
    common structure of the truth conditions for conditional statements by
    giving the connective a single meaning and making
    the selection function a parameter of the interpretation
* Just as we can communicate effectively using quantified sentences without
  explicitly specifying a domain,
  so we can communicate effectively using conditional sentences without
  explicitly specifying an s-function
  * This suggests that there are further rules beyond those in semantics,
    governing the use of conditional sentences
  * the subject matter of a pragmatics of conditionals
  * Very little can be said about pragmatic rules for the use of conditionals
    since the logic has not advanced beyond the propositional stage
* a few speculative remarks
  about the kinds of research which may provide a framework for treatment
  (of conditionals and related pragmatic problems in the philosophy of science)
1. If we had a functional logic with a conditional connective
  * (\forall x)(Fx > Gx) is the form of a law of nature
  * says, not just that every actual F is a G, but further
    that for every possible F, if it were an F, it would be a G
  => Hempel's confirmation paradox does not arise,
     since "All ravens are black" is not logically equivalent to
     "All non-black things are non-ravens."
  * Also, the relation between counterfactuals and laws
    * laws support counterfactuals because they entail them
    "If this dove were a raven, it would be black" is simply an instantiation of
    "All ravens are black."
2. Goodman; the pragmatic problem of counterfactuals is one of
  a cluster of closely related problems concerning induction and confirmation
  * the source of these difficulties: the general problem of projectability,
    = when can a predicate be validly projected from one set of cases to others?
    or when is a hypothesis confirmed by its positive instances?
  * Some way is needed to distinguish between natural predicates and those which
    are artificially constructed
  * Pragmatic criteria for measuring the inductive properties of predicates
    might provide pragmatic criteria for ordering possible worlds
3. striking structural parallels between
  conditional logic and conditional probability functions
  * suggests the possibility of a connection between
    inductive logic and conditional logic
  * A probability assignment and an s-function are two quite different ways to
    describe the inductive relations among propositions
  * drawing a connection between them might be illuminating for both

# VI. Conclusion: empiricism and possible worlds 12

* Writers of fiction and fantasy sometimes suggest that
  imaginary worlds have a life of their own beyond the control of the creators
* The skeptic believes that nothing goes into a fictional world, or a possible
  world, unless it is put there by decision or convention; it is a
  * creature of invention and not discovery
  * Tolkien (1966) admits that Faerie is a land "full of wonder, but not of
    information"
* the empiricist may be uncomfortable about a theory which
  treats counterfactuals as literal statements about non-actual situations
  * Counterfactuals are often contingent, and contingent statements must be
    supported by evidence
  * But evidence can be gathered, by us at least, only in this universe
* how possible worlds, even if the product of convention, can be subjects of
  empirical investigation
* I can partially define a possible world in such a way
  that I am ignorant of some of the determinate truths in that world
  * eg attribute to it features of the actual world which are unknown to me.
  * eg "I am thinking of a possible world in which the population of China is
    just the same, on each day, as it is in the actual world
  * there are already things true in it which I shall never know
* Conditionals do implicitly, and by convention,
  what is done explicitly by stipulation in this example
* counterfactuals are generally about possible worlds which are very much like
  the actual one, and defined in terms of it => evidence is so often relevant to
  their truth
* eg what would have happened if I had asked my boss for a raise yesterday, I am
  * this world has the same history, up to yesterday, as the actual world, the
    same boss with the same dispositions and habits
  * I do not know everything about the boss's habits and dispositions in the
    actual world => there is a lot that I do not know about how he acts in the
    possible world that I have chosen
  * I might find out by watching him respond to a similar request from another,
    or by asking his sectetary about his mood yesterday
  * These bits of information about the actual world would not be decisive
  * nT they would be relevant, since they tell me more about the non-actual
    situation that I have selected
* If I make a conditional statement subjunctive or otherwise
  and the antecedent turns out to be true,
  then whether I know it or not, I have said something about the actual world,
  namely that the consequent is true in it
* The conditional provides
  a set of conventions for selecting possible situations
  which have a specified relation to what actually happens
=> it is possible for statements about unrealized possibilities to tell us about
  the world
  * not just about the speaker's imagination

# Notes 14
