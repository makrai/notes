The structure of a semantic theory
Jerrold J. Katz & Jerry A. Fodor
1963

#Intro

* characterize the form of [a semantic theory of a natural language]
* results ... will apply directly to ... languages closely related to English
* semantic structure ... supplied by descriptive research
* lack of an adequate theory to organize, systematize, and generalize these
  facts ... contributed in abundance by many diverse fields, including
  philosophy, linguistics, philology, and psychology
  * theories [have] been either too loosely formulated or
    * too weak in explanatory and descriptive power

#2 The projection problem

* by studying the contribution that semantics will be required to make to a
  synchronic description of a language we can clarify the subject, the form
  of generalizations, the goals, and the empirical and methodological
  constraints upon a semantic theory
* infinite number of sentences <= rules, the _projection problem_

#3. Synchronic linguistic description minus grammar equals semantics p4

* [Syntacit parses] specify the elements out of which a sentence is
  constructed, the grammatical relations between these elements and between the
  higher constituents of the sentence, the relations between the sentence and
  other sentences of the language, and the ways the sentence is syntactically
  ambiguous together with an explanation of why it is ambiguous in these ways
* the grammar provides identical structural descriptions for sentences that are
  different in meaning and different structural descriptions for sentences that
  are identical in meaning
* Later in this section we will fix an upper bound [on the domain of semantics]
  by determining what problems lie outside the concerns of a complete
  linguistic description
* Grammars seek to describe the structure of a sentence in isolation from its
  possible settings in linguistic discourse (written or verbal) or in non-
  linguistic context (social or physical)
* thought exper: A number of English-speakers receive an anonymous letter
  containing only the English sentence `S`. We are interested in the difference
  between this type of situation and one in which the same anonymous letter
  is received by persons who do not speak English but are equipped with a
  completely adequate grammar of English
  * The bill is large
    * ...but need not be paid
  * The paint is silent
  * paraphrase
* a valósággal nem kapcsolja össze (utasítások végrehajtása, igazságérték)

#4. What is beyond the descriptive scope of a semantic theory p8

* upper bound
* Previous conceptions
  * the manner in which settings determine how an utterance is understood
  * too high [goal]
* a function F whose
  * arguments are a
    * sentence S;
    * GS, a grammatical description of S;
    * IS ... the set of possible readings of S, and
    * C, an abstract characterization of a setting
  * [returns zero or more] readings in IS that speakers of the language give to S
    * _The shooting of the hunters was terrible._
* what is a setting
  1. the full sociophysical environment of the utterance, or
  2. the written or spoken discourse
  * critique of full environment
    * it would be required that the theory represent all the knowledge 
      speakers have about the world
    * Our store sells alligator/horse shoes
    * Joe jumped higher than the Empire State Building/you;
    * _Black cats are unlucky_ and _People who break mirrors are unlucky_
    * none of these considerations is intended to rule out the possibility
      that, by placing relatively strong limitations on the information about
      the world that a theory can represent in the characterization of a
      setting, a _limited_ theory of selection by sociophysical setting can be
      constructed. What these considerations do show is that a _complete_
      theory of this kind is impossible
  * discourse
    * strong and a weak version
    * a speaker may need to bring to bear virtually any information about the
      world that he and other speakers share, the argument given against a
      complete theory of selection by sociophysical setting applies equally
      against the strong version of a theory of selection by discourse
    * weak version of such a theory requires only that the theory interpret
      discourses just so far as the interpretation is determined by grammatical
      and semantic relations which obtain within and among the sentences of the
      discourse

#5. The components of a semantic theory p13

* dictionary
* in what respects a dictionary and grammar alone are _not_ sufficient to match
  the fluent speaker's interpretations of sentences?
  * WSD
* rules for applying the information in the dictionary
  * rules which take account of semantic relations between morphemes and of the
    interaction between meaning and syntactic structure

#6. The structure and evaluation of dictionary entries p15

* two parts: POS and senses
* sense: a SENSE-CHARACTERIZATION and one or more synonyms (optional)
* sense-characterization
* bachelor
  * unenclosed elements are GRAMMATICAL MARKERS, the
  * parentheses: SEMANTIC MARKERS, and the
  * brackets: DISTINGUISHERS
* semantic markers: semantic structure _in_ a dictionary entry and the semantic
  relations _between_ dictionary entries
  * formal relations between markers and distinguishers
* semantic relations which can be reconstructed from entries in our normal form
  but not from entries in the conventional dictionary form. One such relation
  is that of SEX-ANTONYMY
* Semantic markers are the elements in terms of which semantic relations are
  expressed in a theory. Here there is a strong analogy to grammatical markers,
  since a grammatical marker (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.) is an element in
  terms of which syntactic relations are expressed
* semantic markers assigned to a lexical item in a dictionary entry are
  intended to reflect whatever systematic semantic relations hold between that
  item _and the rest of the vocabulary_ of the language
* distinguishers assigned to a lexical item are intended to reflect what is
  idiosyncratic about its meaning
  * a change in a distinguisher merely alters the relation between one item and
    its synonyms
* disambiguation
* Semantic anomaly can then be construed as the limiting case of selection: the
  case where there is a lexical item in a sentence whose paths are ALL excluded
  by selections due to other material in the sentence
* selection
* the basis on which to decide to represent some lexical information by
  semantic markers and other lexical information by distinguishers. p21
* _The old bachelor finally died_, adding a new marker
* systematic econmy
* the relation between features of certain combinations into which a lexical
  item enters and the sense which the item bears in those combinations
  * honest:
    * ... 3. of persons: of good moral character, virtuous, upright, ...
    * of women: chaste, virtuous, ...
    * `<...>`
* (follow conventional dictionary procedure)
* whether the items are to be words, morphemes, or other units 
  * we do not attempt to decide here;
* no mechanical discovery/decision procedure

#7. The projection rule component p25

#8. Metatheory p39

* metatheory for semantics must [represent] semantic universals
* an enumeration of the semantic markers from which the theoretical vocabulary
  of each particular semantic theory is drawn
* For example ... the theory requiring the smallest number of markers
* relation between grammatical and semantic markers
* `male`, `female`, `human`, `animal`, `animate`, `concrete`, `abstract`
  appear to fall into this overlap
  * overlap exists in name only
