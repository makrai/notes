* we detecting and rating humor in short texts
  based on a popular linguistic theory of humor. The proposed technical method
* sentence embeddings are fed to separate lines of hidden layers in a neural
  network (one line for each sentence) to extract latent features. At last, the
  parallel lines are concatenated to determine the congruity and other
  relationships between the sentences and predict the target value. We
* a novel dataset for humor detection consisting of 200,000 formal short texts.
* we participated in a live machine learning competition focused on rating
  humor in Spanish tweets
  * F1 scores of 0.982 and 0.869 in the humor detection experiments which
    outperform general and SOTA models. The evaluation performed 
  * two contrasting settings confirm the strength and robustness of the model
* two important factors in achieving high accuracy in the current task: 1)
  * usage of sentence embeddings and 
  * utilizing the linguistic structure of humor in designing the proposed model
