# 4 Three conceptualizations of events 78

* We focus on the last two approaches
* sentience is sometimes implicated in argument realization
  * cannot always be subsumed under causal notions or in aspect
* the term “event structure” is now widely used to refer to 
  the lexical semantic representation which determines argument realization.
  * consensus that such representations encode properties of events.
  * hE fundamental differences among the representations that have been
  * alternative hypotheses about which semantic properties of events influence
    argument realization and, thus, are central to the organization of event
  * this chapter is to delineate theories concerning these semantic properties.
  * Semantic properties of events are shown to be relevant for the orga-
    nization of event structure to the extent that the subclasses of events
    which they define share identifiable grammatical properties. We present a
  * these properties under the rubric of theories of event conceptualization
  * a hypothesis about what facets of an event are grammatically relevant is a
    hypothesis about how language users conceptualize happenings in the world
  * those properties of events that are grammatically relevant are also
    cognitively salient in some pretheoretically intuitive way (B. Levin and
    Pinker 1991) and that such properties
    * should find their way into semantic representations.

* three ways of conceptualizing events have been proposed to be gramm relevant
  * each focuses on a distinct cognitively salient facet of events. The
  1. localist approach, highlights the notions of motion and location. The
  2. aspectual approach: the temporal properties of events,
    including their mereological (part–whole) structure, are central
  3. causal approach, notions such as “causal chains” of event participants and
     “transmission of force” between these participants play a major role. We
* for each proposal, illustrate the types of lexical semantic representations
  proposed to encode the relevant facets of an event.  Although these
  * not always developed to account for argument realization, it is 
    nL possible to compare how each fares in this respect.  Our 
  * Our concerns.  Primary: how well each determins the subject & direct object
    * and the morphosyntactic expression of the subject and object.  We briefly
    * predictions concerning the realization of arguments as obliques;
      * for fuller studies in several theoretical frameworks of this question
        see Croft (1991), Jolly (1993), Markantonatou and Sadler (1995), and
        Wechsler (1995). We also consider 
    * how each approach deals with argument alternations
* There are several versions of each approach, and as we cannot review all in
  * we focus on what is common to most instantiations of a particular approach,
  * paying specific attention to the properties in recent research. Following

## The localist approach

* An early attempt at introducing organizing principles to provide a logic
  underlying the assignment of semantic roles is found in Gruber (1965), who
  * an explicitly localist approach to the representation of events.  The basic
  * events involving motion and location in space are central to the construal
    of all events and that 
    * the machinery used for representing motion and location events is
      harnessed for the description of events which are not obviously events
      of spatial motion and location. It is 
  * Jackendoff (1972, 1976, 1983, 1987, 1990b) who formalizes and most fully
    develops the localist approach to event structure representation, so we
  * see the work of J M Anderson (1971, 1977) for another localist approach,
  * van Voorst (1993) combines facets of the causal and localist approaches.
  * Jackendoff’s earliest work (1972) makes use of semantic role lists , 
  * he early on adopted a predicate decomposition approach to lexical semantics
    * predicate decompositions is not necessary for a localist approach.
  * Anderson’s approach, which is more strictly localist than Jackendoff’s,
    * semantic role lists, using 
    * roles that are defined in terms of combinations of features.
* two major types of events: motion and location events; each type has its own
  * Location events involve a thing & a location (eg The vase sat on the shelf)
  * motion events involve a thing and the path that it travels along (eg The)
  * The moving or located entity is known as the theme (see section 2.4), and
    * every event must have a theme.  Jackendoff further distinguishes between
  * two types of locational verbs: those which describe 
    * states (eg the verb be and all stative verbs) and 
    * those which, like motion verbs, are eventive (eg _remain, stay_ when
      predicated of animates)
  * The predicates go, be, and stay, respectively, are used to represent
    motional verbs and the two types of locational verbs – stative and
  * causative events that embed events of each of these three types.
    (1) a. The rock fell from the roof to the ground.  
        b. Linda lowered the rock from the roof to the ground.
        c. Linda dropped the rock from the roof to the ground.
        (Jackendoff 1976: 104, (35))
  * the (b) and (c) sentences exemplify causative and permissive agency resp; the
    * causative can be paraphrased with make or cause and the verb fall (eg
      ‘Linda made the rock go down from the roof to the ground’), while the
    * permissive can be paraphrased with let and fall (eg ‘Linda let the rock
      => two causative primitive predicates, cause and let
    * (See Jackendoff [1990b] for further refinements of the typology of
      causatives, building on Talmy’s [1988] work on “force dynamics.”)

## The aspectual approach 86

* the internal temporal make-up of events provides the needed semantic vocab.
  * the temporal and mereological properties of predicates describing events
  * variants differ on the best characterization of these properties.  This
* long tradition in both linguistics and philosophy of classifying verbs
  according to lexical aspect (sometimes referred to as “aktionsart”).

* Aspectual classes were introduced to account for a variety of ling phenomena
  * Initially, these phenomena did not include argument realization; rather,
  * differences among verbs with respect to the interpretation of tense, the
    availability of the progressive, the distribution of various types of
    temporal adverbials, and the availability of certain entailments; see Dowty
    (1979: 60) for a summary.  Aspectual classes were also developed to account
  * parallels between the denotational domains of nominal and verbal predicates
    and the interactions between the two (eg, Bach 1981, 1986; Krifka 1986,
    1989a, 1989b, 1992; Verkuyl 1972, 1993)
  * Later in accounts of phenomena involving argument realization.

* In this section we review aspectual approaches to event conceptualization,
  * aspectual properties which have been implicated in argument realization, as
  * debates over the best characterization of these properties and the way in
  * not do justice to the full richness and depth of the vast linguistic and
    philosophical literature on lexical aspect. We simply mention some of the
  * major linguistic studies of lexical aspect Bach (1981, 1986), Binnick
    (1991), Brinton (1988), Dowty (1979), Filip (1999), Freed (1979), Krifka
    (1989a, 1989b, 1992, 1998), Moens and Steedman (1988), Mourelatos (1978),
    Smith (1991), Tenny (1994), Vendler (1957), and Verkuyl (1972, 1993, 1999).
  * studies of argument realization often confusing aspectual with nonaspectual
  * not all semanticists working on aspect are aware of the full range of
    issues involved in the morphosyntactic realization of arguments.
    => Therefore, this section attempts to provide a critical review of the
    relevant literature, to correct some misconceptions, and to bring research
    on the semantic foundations of aspectual notions together with that on the
    relevance of these notions to argument realization.

### 4.2.1 the aspectual classes most commonly found in existing asp classifs

* the specific semantic properties which are said to be crucial in defining
* those aspectual properties which also figure in aspect-driven theories of
  argument realization

### 4.2.2 an overview of the properties which are common to most theories of
argument realization which take aspect to be the dominant factor 

### 4.2.3 the evidence which is commonly taken to support the aspectual
approach to argument realization

### 4.2.4 challenges to this approach

## The causal approach 117

* takes causal notions to be central to determining argument realization. There
  * Croft (1990, 1991, 1994, 1998), DeLancey (1984, 1985, 1990, 1991),
    Jackendoff (1990b), Langacker (1987, 1990, 1991, 1993), and 
    van Voorst (1988, 1993, 1995)
    * most are inspired by Talmy’s work on causation (1976, 1988)
  * For presentational purposes, we focus on Croft’s formulation of this
    * particularly comprehensive and explicit, though we include references to
  * The most detailed analyses of causal notions and their grammatical
    consequences are found mainly in cognitive and functional frameworks,
    and, therefore, our explication of these notions is couched in the terms
    of those frameworks
    * unclear to us whether there is a conceptual affinity between
      the causal approach to event conceptualization and
      the theoretical underpinnings of these frameworks; we leave this open
* models events as causal chains, consisting of a series of segments, 
  * each segment relates two participants in the event; a single participant
    may be involved in more than one segment. Verbs name segments of such a
    causal chain. The main features of an event conceptualized in causal chain
    terms, as set out by Croft (1991: 173), are listed below. (Croft adds
    additional assumptions later in the book [1991: 269], but the assumptions
    cited here are the central ones.) 
  (49) 
    1. a simple event [ie what is named by the verb] is a (not necessarily
       atomic) segment of the causal network; 
    1. simple events are nonbranching causal chains; 
    1. a simple event involves transmission of force; 
    1. transmission of force is asymmetric, with distinct participants as
       initiator and endpoint (Croft 1991: 173)

According to Croft (1991: 173) “
* The prototypical event type that fits this model is 
  unmediated volitional causation that brings about a change in the entity
  acted on (ie, the manifestation of the transmission of force), that is, the
  prototypical transitive event ␁ ␁ ␁ ” (see also section 1.5). This model is
  schematized in (50).  (Croft [1994: 37, n. 5])
* notation: 
  * a dot indicates a participant; an 
  * arrow indicates a relationship of transmission of force, which 
    can be described by the capitalized label just below it; a 
  * line without an arrowhead indicates a noncausal (stative) relation; a
  * parenthesized dot indicates that it is the same participant as in the
    preceding causal (or noncausal) segment

## The aspectual and causal approaches compared

## Conclusion

# 5 The mapping from lexical semantics to syntax 131

* two hypotheses about which facets of event structure are preserved
* mapping preserves
  * equivalence classes of arguments or predicates or
  * prominence relations in the event structure

## Equivalence class preservation constraints
## Prominence preservation constraints
## Types of mapping algorithms
## Conclusion

# 6 Thematic hierarchies in argument realization 154

* reasons for the prevalence of hierarchy theories
  * prominence relations in the event structure are preserved in the syntax
  * recognizing priorities among meaning components relevant to linking
    * outside the structure of event structure

## Thematic hierarchies: appealing, but problematic
## The primary motivation for hierarchies: context dependence
## Formulations of the thematic hierarchy
## The grounding of the thematic hierarchy
## Towards an understanding of differences between thematic hierarchies

# 7 Multiple argument realization 186

* alternations as illustrated with the causative alternation
* some alternations appear to be meaning driven
  (ie, are a by-product of verbal polysemy)
* information status and heaviness of a verb’s arguments

## Projectionist and constructional perspectives
## Alternations involving a “single” set of arguments
## Information-packaging considerations and more
## Multiple argument realization involving event composition
## The distribution of verb classes in multiple argument realization
