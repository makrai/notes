#1. Some previous models

##1.1. Statistical models of Mandelbrot and Simon

* due to two prominent figures in 20th-century science
  * Benoît Mandelbrot, of fractals fame, and
  * Herbert A. Simon, one of the founding fathers of
    AI and complex systems theory
* Mandelbrot (1966): _random typing_
  * reason (Li 1992)
    * the number of possible words of a given length is exponential in length
      (since all characters are equiprobable), and
      the probability of any ... word is also exponential in its length
* Zipf’s law is “linguistically shallow” (Mandelbrot, 1982)
  * the number of distinct words of the same length in real language is
    not exponential in length and is not even monotonic
* proposed by Simon (1955, 1957). It is
  * based on a much earlier [model] by Yule (1925), who introduced his model
    * in the context of evolutionary biology (distribution of species among
      genera)
    * Currently ... known as
      _preferential attachment_ or _cumulative advantage_ models
    * growth rate of an object is proportional to its current size
    * define an n-word as a word that has occurred exactly n times
      * a text is generated sequentially word by word, and that
      the probability for the next word to be one of the n-words is equal to
      the fraction of all n-word tokens in the preceding sequence

##1.2. Guiraud’s semic matrices

* Pierre Guiraud ... suggested that
  * Zipf’s law "would be produced by the structure of the signified"
    (Guiraud, 1968)
  * suppose that all word meanings can be represented as superpositions of a
    small number of elementary meanings, or _semes_.
    * In keeping with the structuralist paradigm,
    * each seme is a binary opposition,
      * such as animate/inanimate or actor/process (Guiraud’s examples). Each
      * can be positive, negative, or unmarked in any given word. Assuming that
      * seme values can be combined with each other without constraints
        words increases roughly exponentially with the number of marked semes.
      * If all semes have the same probability of coming up in a speech
        situation, the probability of a word with m marked semes is also
        exponential in m. This leads to Zipf’s distribution for words

##1.3. Models based on optimality principles

* Zipf’s law maximizes some quantity
* Zipf himself
  * “effort minimization” on the part of both speaker and listener
    * the broader the meaning of a word, the more common it is,
      because it is usable in more situations
  * More common words are more accessible in memory, so their use
    * minimizes the speaker’s effort. On the other hand, they
    * increase the listener’s effort,
      because they require extra work on disambiguation of diffuse meanings
  * As ... a compromise between speaker and listener, a distribution emerges
* quantitative model based on these ideas
  * by Mandelbrot (1953)
    * optimizes the cost of speech production per bit of information
      transferred
    * Zipf’s law follows under the assumptions that
      1. the cost of a word is proportional to its length, and
      2. the number of words of a given length in language
        is also proportional to that length. In this form,
    * the model turns out to be the reformulation of the random typing model
    > These variants are fully equivalent mathematically, but they appeal to
    > [...] different intuitions (Mandelbrot 1966)
  * Balasubrahmanyan and Naranan (2002)
    * derivation ... related to the permutation of identical word tokens in the
      text
  * Ferrer i Cancho 2005a, 2005b, and references therein
    * papers
      * Decoding least effort and scaling in signal frequency distributions. Ph
      * Hidden communication aspects in the exponent of Zipf’s law. Glottomet
    * a finite set of words and a finite set of objects or stimuli with a
      many-to-many mapping between the two
    * polysemy and synonymy
    * It is assumed that the frequency of a word is
      proportional to the number of objects it is linked to
    * optimality principles and, in some cases, constraints,
      * with the meaning of coder’s effort, decoder’s effort,
        mutual entropy between words and objects, entropy of signals, etc
    * maximizing goal functions constructed from
      combinations of these quantities, Ferrer i Cancho demonstrated the
      emergence of Zipf’s law
* we show that Zipf’s law can be obtained as
  * a consequence of a purely linguistic notion of
    avoidance of excessive [túlzott] synonymy
* We argue that
  * words with different degrees of specificity are needed for efficient
    communication (Section 2)
  * Zipf’s law can result from a particular way of
    arranging word meanings over the space of all meanings (Section 3)
  * such arrangements can naturally arise
    from the historical dynamics under which
    1. word meanings tend to expand, and
    2. close synonyms are disfavored (Sections 4, 5)

#2. Synonymy, polysemy, semantic space 6

* a measure so that we can speak of words being more “specific” or “generic”
* _together_, _join_, _couple_, and _fastener_ have meanings that are subsets
  of the meaning of _and_. By that we mean that whenever one of these words
  comes up in a speech situation, _and_ also comes up, even if it is not
  uttered, because each of them evokes a mental image with an essential
  component of separate entities being combined in some way
* we assume that the frequency of the word w is
  proportional to the extent of its meaning, i.e., to the measure μ(m(w))
* estimate of meaning extent from such quantities as
  * the length of the word’s dictionary definition or
  * the number of all hyponyms
* Baayen and Fermin Moscoso Del Prado (2005) found a
  * statistically significant correlation between the frequency of a verb and
    the number of synonymic sets it is a part of in English and Dutch
* We also provide a different kind of experimental evidence for proportionality
  between frequency and meaning extent in Appendix
  * OFF V. Konetsky (1980), radio communications of Russian WWII fighter pilots
    in a dogfight environment, where a split-second delay can be fatal,
    consisted almost entirely of such pseudo-obscene placeholder words,
* Zipfian minimization of effort
  * frequency effect is known in psycholinguistics
    * the more frequent the word, the more readily it is retrieved
      (Akmajian, Harnish, Demers, & Farmer, 1995; Carroll, 1994)
  * However, contrary to Zipf, it doesn’t seem plausible that such a
    generalization makes understanding more difficult for the _listener_

#3. Zipf’s law and Zipfian coverings 9

* each point in S is covered by a sequence of words with more and more precise
  (narrow, specific) meanings, with precision growing in geometric progression
* we now turn to the mechanisms and regularities of word meaning change.
  * two basic processes: meaning expansion and avoidance of close synonymy

#4. Zipfian coverings and avoidance of excessive synonymy 12

* narrowing is typically a result of competition between words 
  (except for the relatively rare cases where [ the ] denoted disappears).
  e.g. _hlaf_ [OE `bread`] lost its generic sense only because it was supplanted
  by the expanding _bread_
  * [like] the “blocking” effect (Briscoe, 2006) where a 
    * regular word derivation, such as _stealer_ from _steal_, is preempted
* senses of a polysemous word as subsets of its entire meaning
* polysemy
  * persists [only] if one of the senses is significantly more common
  * can be interpreted as an example of meaning competition
  * meanings do not interact (compete)
    * if they are sufficiently different in scope, whether they belong to
    * the same word (polysemy) or to different words (synonymy)

#5. Numerical models

* two numerical models
  * simulate the two basic processes by which word meanings change in extent

#6. Discussion

* The assumption of proportionality of word frequency to the extent of its
  meaning
  * Appendix
  * estimate of word meaning extent might be obtained on the basis of the
    Moscow semantic school’s Meaning–Text Theory
    (e.g., Mel’čuk, 1988; Mel’čuk, 1997)
* other, more specific, skewed distributions in the language have been observed,
  * some approximating power or exponential laws more or less loosely
    * (see, e.g., Briscoe (2006) and references therein), but
  * the original Zipf’s law still stands out in terms of
    both fit quality and stability of the exponent

#Appendix Meaning and frequency p20

* Suppose that some “head” word `w_0` has a set of partial synonyms and/or
  hyponyms (“specific” words) `{w_0^1 , . . . , w_0^n}`, whose meanings
  together cover the meaning of `w_0` without gaps and overlaps. We can make
  that judgement even without being able to measure meaning extent. Then, by
  definition, their total meaning extent is equal to that of `w_0` . In that
  case, the frequency hypothesis predicts that the sum total of hyponym
  frequencies should be close to the frequency of the head word
* For instance the net frequency of
  * all specific tree names found in Sharoff’s dictionary (n.d.) is 247/mln,
  * words дерево, деревцо ‘tree, also dimin.’ is 233/mln,
  which is remarkably close
