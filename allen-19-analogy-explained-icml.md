# Abstract

* Word embeddings exhibit seemingly linear behaviour
  * e.g. the embeddings of analogy “woman is to queen as man is to king”
  * intriguing since the embeddings are not trained to achieve it. Several
  * explanations have been proposed
  * hE each introduces assumptions that do not hold in practice
* We derive a probabilistically grounded definition of paraphrasing that we
  re-interpret as word transformation
  a mathematical description of _wx is to wy_
  * From these concepts we
    prove existence of linear relationship between W2V-type embeddings that
    underlie the analogical phenomenon, identifying explicit error terms.
