Mathematics and the Internet: A Source of Enormous Confusion and Great Potential

* realization that large-scale, real-world networks such as the Internet evolve
  over time has motivated the mathematically challenging problem of developing
  a theory of _graph sequences and graph limits_ [17, 19, 20]
  * underlying idea is that properly defined graph limits can be expected to
    represent viable models for some of the enormous dynamic graph structures
    that arise in real-world applications and seem too unwieldy to be described
    via more direct or explicit approaches
