# Abstract

* This paper reviews literature on psychosocial adaptation in ICE environments,
  * focusing on
    polar work groups and expedition teams, and simulation and actual space
  * Long-duration missions may involve chronic exposure to many stressors that
    can negatively impact behavioral health, performance and even safety.
  * In the last decades, scientific studies
    * anecdotal evidence has been replaced
    * temporal, social, and individual determinants of psychosocial adaptation,
    * countermeasures that may minimize or prevent potential problems. Still,
    * issues remain that require additional investigation, specifically in
      * integration of psychosocial and neurobiological adaptation. A
* ICE environments as laboratories for studies of fundamental psycho questions

# 1 Intro

* the crucial determinant of the stress response is not the environment itself
  but rather the meaning that the individuals attach to their experiences
  (Levine and Ursin 1991).
* This paper concentrates on a subset of environments that share a number of
  similarities that most people are likely to find inherently stressful:
  * polar work groups and expedition teams including Antarctic winter-over
    personnel, and crews of manned space missions and space simulation expers.
  * harsh physical surroundings present many challenges and dangers, including
    * microgravity with the threat of hazardous radiation exposure, or in
      extreme cold, donned in bulky clothing
    * evacuation from these isolated environments may be difficult if not impos
* personal perspective may also include the necessity to interact with a small
  number of possibly mixed gender, culturally diverse individuals living and
  working in close quarters, for example, in a small Antarctic winterover field
  station, or in a tent at the end of a day of trekking
  * the safety of each person is dependent on others in the group,
* we review research dealing with characteristics and determinants of adapt in
  * focusing on individual psychological reactions and group dynamics.
* research on human interactions in polar expeditions or research stations:
  a space analogue, informative about working in space (Stuster 2005)
  * the variability that may exist between ICE settings and even between crews
    operating within the same physical context needs to be recognized. An
  * Input-Process-Output model provides one framework for sorting the myriad of
  * factors affecting human adaptation in ICE environments
    * Variables and their interrelations are portrayed in Fig. 1. In addition
* applied value for the development of evidence-based countermeasures to
  minimize psychological and interpersonal problems among personnel
