# 1 Intro

* SER has been around for more than two decades (Schuller, 2018) and it has
  * applications in
    * human-computer interaction (Cowie+ 2001)
    * robots (Huahu+ 2010)
    * mobile services (Yoon+ 2007)
    * call centers (Gupta and Rajput, 2007)
    * computer games (Szwoch and Szwoch, 2015)
    * psychological assessment
      (Lancker, Cornelius, Kreiman, 1989, Low, Maddage, Lech, Sheeber+, 2011)
* approaches to model the emotions, and it is still an open problem; however,
  the discrete and the dimensional models are commonly used. Therefore, we
  first review the emotional models
* classifier, a supervised learning construct, that will be trained to
  * deep learning have also become common.
* labeled data that have emotions embedded in them. The data requires
* preprocessing before their features can be extracted
* Features are essential to a classification process. They reduce the original
  * four groups; prosodic, spectral, voice quality, and features based on
    Teager energy operator
* features from other modalities, such as visual or linguistic depending on the

# 2 surveys and the areas that they cover

* supporting modalities, such as linguistic, discourse, and video information
* A recent but brief survey by Basu+ highlights publications that involve
  databases, noise reduction techniques for preprocessing signals, features,
  and classifiers including recent advances such as Convolutional and Recurrent
  Neural Networks (Basu+ 2017).
* Sailunaz+ focus on emotion detection from text and speech, where
  * publications that incorporate text information as well as speech signals to
    determine speech are discussed. Unlike other surveys, they also discuss the
    emotional models (Sailunaz+ 2018). Their survey also discusses the recent
    classifiers.
