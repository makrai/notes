# 1 Intro

increased number of target languages. Also, much of the test data will come
from Voice of America (VOA) radio broadcasts. This will be in addition to
conversational telephone speech (CTS), as in previous evaluations.  The test
segments taken from VOA broadcasts will, however, be limited to speech
assessed as being of telephone bandwidth.

## 5.2 TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT DATA

corpora, which are designated VOA2 and VOA3, contain speech in most of the
target languages listed in Table 1 (certain languages included as target
languages in LRE07 will be exceptions) and in a variety of additional
languages as well. All data will be supplied in 8-bit mu- law format. VOA3
programs will have VOA supplied language labels, while those from VOA2 will
have possible language labels created by an automatic procedure, but these
labels have will not have been audited by the LDC or NIST, and may be
erroneous.  Some programs may contain speech in more than one language.  These
are very large corpora each containing thousands of broadcasts consisting
mostly of broadband (not telephone bandwidth) speech. They will be supplied on
two SATA drives of one terabyte each.

For each of the 2009 target languages that are included, there will be 80 or
more designated labeled segments (of approximately 30 seconds duration each)
in either VOA2 or VOA3 that have been audited by the LDC and found to contain
narrowband speech in the target language. These labeled segments may be
especially useful for system training.

## 5.3 EVALUATION DATA

Evaluation data to support the formal evaluation of the language
detection algorithms, mostly collected and audited by the LDC,
will be provided by NIST on a single DVD in the format described
in section 6.2. The data will include 100 or more test segments of
each of the three test durations for each of the target languages
included in the evaluation. Also included will be segments from
languages, other than those listed in Table 1, for each of the three
test durations. The total number of evaluation test segments of all
durations will not exceed 50,000. All segments will be in 8-bit
