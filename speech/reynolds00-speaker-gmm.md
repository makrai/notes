Speaker Verification Using Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models 1
Douglas A. Reynolds, Thomas F. Quatieri, and Robert B. Dunn

# Abstract

likelihood ratio test for verification,
using simple but effective GMMs for likelihood functions, a universal back-
ground model (UBM) for alternative speaker representation, and a form of
Bayesian adaptation to derive speaker models from the UBM.

# 1 Intro

* Bayesian adaptation of speaker models from a universal background model and
  handset-based score normalization,
* referred to as the Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM)

# 2 Likelihood ratio detector

Various terms for this single model are a general model [13], a world model,
and a universal background model [8].
