The Sheffield language recognition system in NIST LRE 2015
Odyssey 2016

# Abstract

* combines three language classifiers. 
  * Two are acoustic-based, which use i-vectors and a tandem DNN language
    recogniser respectively. 
  * The third classifier is a phonotactic language recogniser. 
* Two sets of training data with duration of approximately 170 and 300 hours
  were composed for LR training. 
    * Using the larger set of training data, the primary Sheffield LR system
      gives 32.44 min DCF on the official LR 2015 eval data. A 
* post-evaluation system enhancement was carried out where i-vectors were
  extracted from the bottleneck features of an English DNN
