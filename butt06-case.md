MIRIAM BUTT
Theories of Case
2006 Cambridge University Press

* issues must be dealt with
  * what “case” really means
  * which historically motivated assumptions have served to form the notion
* This book is written primarily from a syntactic point of view
  * case as proposed within various theories of syntax
  * also touches on semantic and morphological issues along the way
* unbroken grammatical traditions back to the ancient Greek and Roman
  * contemporary of the Greek and Roman tradition was the Indian tradition,
    * dates back to at least Pānini’s grammar of Sanskrit (about 600 BCE)
    * remains current in much of Indian linguistic thought today
  * Arabic tradition from the formation of the Muslim Empire (about 700 CE)
* modern: a straightforward comparison across theories is doomed to fail
  * ‘case’ means different things to different people
  * this book focuses on some guiding themes which have been
    consistently associated with an analysis of case phenomena
    * semantic or thematic roles and the role of grammatical relations
    * The book abstracts away from detailed considerations of the morphophon
    * overt realization, how well do each syntactic theory deal with
* syntactic theories considered in this book are
  * Relational Grammar (RG)
  * Government and Binding (GB)
  * the Minimalist Program (MP) or Minimalism,
  * Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG)
  * Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). This does not exhaust the theories
* these are the theories with an active research interest in case per se
* chapter is devoted to
  * linking theories: generalizations between overt case marking,
    argument structure and grammatical relations
  * case within Optimality Theory (OT).  Work in Optimality Theoretic Syntax
    * Grimshaw’s (1997) landmark article
    * field constantly shifting
* The book is organized as follows
  * The remainder of this chapter: some phenomena that have been associated
    with the notion of case
    * includes phenomena which everybody would agree that are indeed case,
    * others which upon closer inspection must be rejected as being case
    * instances of case marking which modern syntax can't deal
      * Some of these phenomena will be encountered again in subsequent chaps
* This book does
  * no exhaustive discussion of the types of case phenomena—see Blake
  * concentrates on a few core phenomena which all theories must account for
    * some constant point of comparison across theories
    * Individual case marking phenomena are introduced along the way as needed
* first part of the book: ideas for case proposed in various syntactic theories
* individual case marking phenomena which have received much attention in synt
  * a discussion of quirky case and ergativity, and the semantics of case

## 1.2 What is Case? 3

* Languages may choose to encode this relationship either
  * structurally in terms of designated positions (eg English) or
  * via overt morphological markers
  * Icelandic or Bulgarian, however, are somewhat of a problem for this view
    * Icelandic employs both strategies simultaneously in that it combines a
      rather rigid word order with a fairly rich and complex case marking sys
      (Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson 1985)
    * The opposite is true of Bulgarian, which has
      * about as much case marking as English does (ie virtually none), but
      * quite some freedom in word order, unlike English
      * word order in Bulgarian is governed by discourse configurational
* remainder of this section for phenomena which continue to be problematic

### 1.2.1. Head vs. Dependent Marking 5

* case-bearing affixes are often historically derived from the incorporation of
  pronouns (eg Jelinek 1987 for Navajo), the two crossreferencing strategies

### 1.2.2. Is Everything Case? — Persian ezafe

### 1.2.3. Adverbial Case 6

* In both Korean and German, optional nonargument measure phrases appear in ACC

### 1.2.4. Case and Finiteness 7

* Case Resistance Principle (Stowell 1981)
  * finiteness and case marking are in complementary distribution
    * non-finite embedded clauses can be case marked, the corresponding
    * embedded finite clause in (10b) bears no case marking

### 1.2.5. Nominal Case 8

* will not figure much in this book
* case marking on nominals which are licensed by other nominals
* standard case for this situation is the genitive, as in
  eg _John’s hat_  or _The destruction of the city._
* often a distinction is made between
  verbal predicates which license verbal case such as nominative and accusative
  nominal predicates which license genitive case
  * hE in some languages verbal nouns allow arguments with either a noml or vbl
  * eg Japanese noun-verb complex predicates with _suru_ ‘do’
    (Grimshaw and Mester 1988)
    * arguments can be either marked with the genitive or dative or acc
  * Urdu examples in (11) illustrate the same type of case marking alternation
    in conjunction with a verbal noun (infinitive)
  * Latin, dubbed the _narrative infinitive_ is shown in (12)
    * no finite head of the sentence as the verb ‘resist’ is infinitive
    * similar examples can be found in French and Russian
* quirky subjects taken up later in the book
  * eg subject marked with a dative. This is contrary to the expectations
  * Icelandic (Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson 1985)

### 1.2.6. Case Stacking 9

* handed down from the Romans, is that each nominal should only bear one case
* Australian languages, which allow case stacking
  * Kayardild is shown in (13). It illustrates the most extreme documented
  * case markers are also put to work as tense/mood/aspect markers in
    * C.OBL (complementizing oblique) indicates that this item is part of the
      embedded complement clause
    * M.ABL is a modal ablative and marks the clause as having past tense
      (together with the finite verb)
    * Both of these suffixes can be argued to be case markers (Evans 1995b)
      as their distribution and morphosyntactic
* The allative, modal proprietive, modal ablative and modal oblique all serve
  to express tense/aspect/mood distinctions
  * Finnish have also been implicated in this type of case usage
* discussed again from the perspective of a formal analysis in chapter 8
  * see Nordlinger and Sadler (2004a,b) for some recent, clear work on this

## 1.3 Levels of Abstractness

* case markers in the Urdu examples are case clitics
  * independent entities: can be separated by other elements eg focus clitics
* Furthermore, the English _to_ as in _I gave milk to the cat_ is generally
  interpreted as a dative case marker
  * syntactic status of preposition
* abstract notion of case in syntax characterizes the
  interaction between verbal lexical semantics,
  grammatical relations and word order
* I will nevertheless pose the question
  whether the theory has anything to say about a typology of case systems,
  * whether the theory worries about the determination of the overt form
  * not the most interesting point of comparison
    (because most of the theories have not given these issues much thought)
  * two other guiding themes
    * semantic or thematic roles and the postulation of grammatical relations
    * how are they expressed or encoded and what role do they play?
* each theory has found differing sets of phenomena of interest
* agreement seems to be that all theories should be able to account for
  * basic transitives, ditransitives,
  * unaccusatives vs. unergatives (section 3.7),
  * passivization,
  * quirky case (section 4.8) and
  * ergativity (chapter 6)

# 2 Foundational Perspectives

## 2.1 Introduction 12

* case is from Latin cāsus, which is in turn a translation of the
  Greek ptōsis ‘fall’: falling away from an assumed standard form
* Sanskrit, around the 6th century BCE, generally attributed to Pānini
  * Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973)
  * relationship between semantic roles and case found in Pānini’s grammar
* three basic elements which will wend their way throughout the book:
  * the role of overt case marking;
  * semantic roles play an important part in the determination of case marking;
  * the realization: grammatical relations
* Hebrew and the Chinese traditions not relevant for modern theories of case

## 2.2 The Greek and Roman Tradition 13

* Aristarchos of Samothrake (217–145 BCE) who lived in Alexandria
  * his student, Dionysios Thrax (ca. 170–90 BCE), wrote a grammar of Greek
* Roman names for the cases are due to Remmius Palaemon: Ars Grammatica
  * mistake in translation: _aitiatike_ had several meanings
  * meaning intended by Thrax was that of affectedness, but the
    Roman translation picked up on the meaning of ‘accused’
  * dative is related to Latin _dare_ ‘to give’
    * recipient, of an object or of a more abstract entity
  * vocative is related to Latin vocāre ‘to call, summon’
* Sanskrit tradition, where the case markers were simply numbered, no sem
* assumption that case must be tied directly to semantics is
  * still implicit in the descriptions of previously undescribed languages
  * made explicit in modern Localist Theories of case and semantic roles (see
    section 7.1 for some discussion), which go back to Gruber (1965)
  * spatial notions are fundamental to our conceptualization of events and
    therefore also to the participants in events
* Tékhnē dealt with locative associations of three cases:
  genitive of origin, dative of location and accusative of direction
  * Byzantine times, the grammarian Maximus Planudes (ca. 1300) dealt with this
  * Hjelmslev (1935:10–12) to see Planudes as the first propounder of a truly
    localist theory of case (Robins 2000:420)
  * found their way into mainstream syntax via Jackendoff (1972, 1990)
    * lexical decomposition, discussed in chapter 5
* Greek and Roman linguistic tradition furnished modern linguistics with
  * basic case terminology
  * the type of case marking in Greek and Latin is taken to be basic
    * case is (pretheoretically) often associated with that type of semantics
  * often unquestioned
  * recurring discussion in the chapters to come

## 2.3 The Indian Tradition 15

* more complicated relationship between case and semantics is assumed
* Pānini’s grammar of Sanskrit (approximately 6th century BCE)
  * not clear whether one person wrote the grammar, or a school
* grammar, known as the Astādhyāyı̄, is a study in compactness and clever coding
  * 4000 interdependent rules,
    ordered mostly by the type of topic addressed and the level of generality
  * more general or default rules are couched so that they may be overridden
  * Without any commentary, the rules come to about 30 printed pages
  * couched extremely compactly in a linguistic metalanguage
  * cases are simply numbered in this grammar. This avoids the prejud assoc
* Pānini was aware of a number of semantic factors which played a role
  * Kāraka Theory: interaction between verbal lexical semantics and
    a theory of semantic roles (Kāraka = doer)
  * semantic roles are defined explicitly as part of the grammar

|apādāna	    |the fixed point from which something recedes (ablative)	|
|sam.pradāna	|the item in view through the karman (goal)	              |
|karan.a	    |the most effective means (instrument)	                  |
|adhikaran.a	|locus, location (locative)	                              |
|karman	      |the thing desired by the agent (patient)	                |
|kartr.	      |the independent one (agent)	                            |

* The possible lexical semantic environments are specified in the grammar by
  reference to particular verb classes or a simple listing
  * eg  ‘The locus is karman (patient)
  with the verbs śı̄N . ‘lie’, sthā ‘stand’, ās ‘sit’, when preceded by
  adhi (preverb meaning roughly ‘above’, ‘over’, ‘on’, ‘on to’)’
* other rules which govern the overt realization of case
* effect of this interacting system of rules: no simple one-to-one
  correspondence between semantic roles and case marking
  * unlike what is assumed in much of standard linguistic theory today
* no terminological classifications to describe deviating patterns
  * eg the accusative of direction or the genitive of origin

## 2.4 The Arabic Tradition 18

* founded in the 8th century CE in the context of an Islamic expandsion
* Sı̄bawaihi (d. 793 CE) is credited as the first on general linguistic princips
* grammar is known as Al-Kit āb (the book) and functioned as
  a model for all subsequent grammars, just as was the case in the Greek/Roman
  and Indian traditions. Sı̄bawaihi’s Al-Kit āb indeed continues to be looked to
* interest in grammar arose as part of larger religious concerns
* syntactic questions are followed by derivational morphology and finally,
  phonology and phonetics
* includes a discussion of case marking, government, and
  a concomitant kísérő notion of reconstruction
  * somewhat reminiscent of ideas in modern linguistic theory (Lechner 1998)
* Arabic is a VSO language
  * accusative (nas. b), genitive (jarr) and nominative (raf‘),
    associated with the underlying vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/, respectively
* Case is in the Arabic tradition embedded within a larger theory of government
  * governors (‘ āmil) such as verbs, prepositions or nominals
    determine the form of a governed element (ma‘ c mūl)
* in the theo, An element cannot have more than one governor and
  no phrasal element may intervene between the governor and the governed
  * grammatical relations do not always have to be expressed by an overt NP
    but as part of the verbal morphology. In (9b) the subject is
    represented by the 3rd singular morphology on the verb ‘see’
  * differentiation between an underlying and a surface level of speech
  * underlying level of representation which included a copy of the verb
* relation between active sentences, passivization, and causativization
  * Sı̄bawaihi: neither could be seen as being derived from the other
  * majority of Arabic grammarians (after Sı̄bawaihi) held that the
    passive was to be derived from an underlying active form and that the
    causative in a complementary relation to the passive, as shown in (14)

# 3 Grammatical Relations

## 3.1 The Structure of Sentences 23

* [20th century eg]
  * syntactic interplay between negation, question words and auxiliaries, or
  * identification of syntactic effects due to elements not visible
* Zellig Harris’ book Structural Linguistics (1951) shows
  * each linguistic entity (element or construction) as composed out of
    specified ordered entities at a lower level
  * A language is then described as consisting of
    specified sets of kernel sentences and a set of transformations
  * transformations either by modifying the kernel sentences of a given set
    or by combining them (in fixed ways) with other kernel sentences
* Noam Chomsky, whose 1957 book Syntactic Structures had a huge impact
* computational concerns. In the wake of World War II
  * vast experience gathered with code cracking
  * machine translation system in order to ‘crack’ Russian
* context-free phrase structure rules provided an elegant way of dealing with
  * language is potentially capable of producing strings of infinite length;
  * context does not always matter
* transformations continue to permeate ideas about case, argument structure
  and grammatical relations

## 3.2 Transformational Grammar, Case and the Passive 24

* transformations was initially in Harris (1957) and Chomsky (1957)
* first generation of Chomsky’s students at MIT, the influential theory of
  Transformational Grammar (TG) truly began to take off
* idea: derive all possible sentences of a given language
  from a set of basic structures
  * One central transformation was one which derived a passive structure
  * transformation is very specific to English
  * absolutely no mention of case in spite of I/me
* comparison between this approach and the view within Arabic linguistics
  * also assumed that the passive was derived from a basic active clause
  * included an explicit statement about case: the passivization of an active
    * transformation of an accusative object into a nominative subject
* extensive debates in the 1970s prompted by
  * language specific character of many of the transformations proposed
  * unconstrained nature
  * Lakoff (1971) and McCawley (1972) showed that
    the use of disjunctive possibilites within transformations
    resulted in a loss of generalization and that
    the kinds of transformations
    permitted an application to arbitrary sets of categories
    (see Bresnan 1977 for a good discussion of the issues at stake)
* Another deep concern was to interface with the new field of formal semantics
  * things that pattern together semantically, but were being
    treated syntactically via several different transformations
* more constrained and very successful theo: Government-Binding (see chapter 4)

## 3.3 Relational Grammar 26

* in the 1970s, spearheaded by David Perlmutter and Paul Postal
* idea was to set up a viable alternative theory to TG
* interaction between grammatical relations, case and thematic roles
  across languages
* one of the founding papers of RG, for example, Perlmutter and Postal (1983b)
  * most languages of the world contain active-passive relations,
  * goal of linguistic theory should be to formulate a language independent
  * SOV languages like Turkish or VSO languages like Malagasy or Arabic
  * need: a level of description which was able to abstract away from the order
  * case marking as a more general method: The nominal that is in the acc,,,
* However, the generalization again does not seem to be valid cross-linguisticl
  * West Greenlandic, where subjects of transitives are in the ergative case
    * object is not overtly marked, as in (7a)
    * often referred to as absolutive case in the literature
* A clause consists of a network of grammatical relations. Among these
  eg ‘subject of’, ‘direct object of’, and ‘indirect object of’
  * A direct object of an active clause is the (superficial) subject of the,,,
  * The subject of an active clause is neither the (superficial) subject,,,
* one needed to abstract away from the surface properties such as
  * relations held between
    * noun phrases and the clause
    * verbs (and other predicational elements) and the clause
  * A basic clause consisted of a network of abstract grammatical relations
  * terminology had been in use for centuries, but had never been formalized

## 3.4 The Notion of Grammatical Relations 28

* Chomsky (1965) includes a structural definition of the grammatical relations
  * structural categorization remains a part of the modern descendants of TG
  * no mention of case, nor is there room for an indirect object
  * To date, the indirect object remains somewhat of an anomaly in this trad,
* Case Theory emerged in the revised version of the theory known as GB

## 3.5 Case Grammar and Thematic Roles 29

* Fillmore’s (1968) paper on _The case for case_ was situated squarely egyenesn
  * saw himself as proposing a variant of TG; however, his Case Grammar turned
  * shares some fundamental ideas with Tesnière’s (1959) Dependency Grammar
  * fruitful debate
  * subsequently incorporated across differing theo approaches, including GB
* case roles/frames are among the common universal bases of language, ie
  some form of case plays a role in all languages
  * a deep structure at which underlying syntactic relations are coded
  * distinct from notions like
    * ‘object of’ and ‘subject of’ (as discussed in section 3.4)
      * the overt realization of case
  * basic part of a sentence contains a proposition P which contains a
    tenseless set of relationships involving verbs and nouns
* relationships needed for crosslinguistic analysis include at the very least:
  Agentive, Instrumental, Dative, Factitive, Locative, Objective
  * Agentive (A) The case of the typically animate perceived instigator
  * Instrumental (I) the inanimate force or object causally involved
  * Dative (D) The case of the animate being affected by the state or action
  * Factitive (F) object or being resulting from the action or state
    * or understood as part of the meaning of the verb
  * Locative (L) The case which identifies the location or spatial orientation
  * Objective (O) The semantically most neutral case, the case of anything
    * role identified by the semantic interpretation of the verb itself;
    * limited to things which are affected by the action or state
* intransitive clause, for example, might consist of a verb and an
  agentive or objective case relation, depending on how ‘active’ the subject is
  * V+A (intransitive, active subject)
  * V+O (intransitive, inactive subject)
  * V+O+A (transitive)
  * V+O+D+A  (ditransitive)
* Fillmore’s idea was via a series of transformations as in TG
  * Chomsky (1965:64– 71) argued that an integration of notions such as O,
    A, D or Subject into the categorical structure of a tree was mistaken
  * Case Grammar as a variant of TG was thus not accepted
  * hE, the notion of a deep structure which licensed certain thematic roles
    became an integral part of linguistic theory
  * The concept of thematic roles emerged as part of the discussion
* determination of case relations or thematic roles was not always easy. 
  * eg _dollars buy, smell sickened, accident killed_ all the same kind of I?
  * Should instrumentals in general be allowed to surface as subjects when a,,?
  * Most linguists agree that thematic roles are a problematic concept, but
    no consensus has been reached on how to do without the notion
* Dowty’s (1991) notion of proto-roles
  * defines an agent or patient proto-role by means of a
    collection of semantic entailments and is thus able to abstract away from
* The thematic roles that are generally used include
  agent, patient, theme, goal, beneficiary, experiencer, instrument, and loc
* thematic hierarchies, Mapping or Linking Theory (see chapter 8)
* other (than RG) lasting effects Fillmore’s paper on linguistic theory
  * each case relationship should occur only once in a simple clause
    * found its way into GB/Minimalism as the θ-criterion in (18), which states
      * for each argument of a clause (typically an NP),
        there can be only one thematic or θ-role and that
        the same thematic role cannot be assigned to more than one argument
    * demonstrates that Fillmore had nothing to do with the surface
      _Der Drache lehrte mich das Fürchten.  ‘The dragon taught me fear.’
  * classification of languages by the case marking patterns
    * how they mark the agentive (A) of a transitive clause
      * ergative languages tend to mark the agent with an ergative and the
        objective (O) with a nominative or absolutive
        * the latter is the same marker that is used for subjects of intrans
      * accusative languages such as English or German distinguish the object
        * group subjects together by marking subjects of both transitive and in
      * discussed in chapter 6
    * differs markedly from previous approaches
      finding a unifying semantics for individual case morphemes, as in the
      * Jakobson (1936) or the localist (Hjelmslev 1935), see section 7.1
* RG was one of the first theories to
  deal with case, grammatical relations and thematic roles seriously

## 3.6 Core Ideas of Relational Grammar 33

* analysed a large and diverse set of languages
* A representative collection of work within RG: Perlmutter (1980),
  Perlmutter (1983), Perlmutter & Rosen (1984) & Perlmutter & Joseph (1990)

###.3.6.1 The Passive Revisited 33

* relations
  * grammatical relations (the so-called ‘term’ relations)
    subject, direct object, and indirect object
    * primitives of theory: cannot be defined in terms of other properties eg
      word order, phrase structure configurations or case marking
    * named by integers, and
      occupy the upper range of a hierarchy of nominal relations
  * lower ranked non-term relations include both
    * oblique relations (corresponding roughly to adjuncts) and the
    * ‘chômeur’ relation (see below)
      * word meaning ‘unemployed’ or ‘idle’
      * not bear the term relation in that stratum that it bears in a higher one
* predicates (mainly verbs) and terms (grammatical relations) represented
  by Relational Networks. With time, a simplified notation
  * arcs, which represent the relations between nodes, which are elements
  * nodes represented by integers. In (22), the P arc denotes the relation
* some kinds of clauses are considered to be more basic than other kinds
  eg passivization applies universally to a network with a 1 and a 2 arc
  * two strata
    * initial stratum is identical to the analysis of the active sentence
    * second stratum, the status of the terms has changed
* laws and rules
  * laws are formulated as universal and inviolable constraints
  * rules could be language particular and allow for operations on rel networks
  * As RG was developed, the system grew to be quite large and intricate, as
    many laws interacted with one another. This section discusses only some
  * For example, take the general
    * 1-Advancement Exclusiveness Law in (24)
      * constraints on the advancement within a given network
      * Advancement rules allow a 2 or 3 node to advance to a higher int
    * Stratal Uniqueness Law in (25), which prohibits more than one subject
    * Chômeur (Cho) or Argument Demotion: nominal j becomes a chômeur
      * cannot be realized as a term but just as a non-term (adjunct)
    * Final 1 Law in (27): each clause must contain a subject in the final
* transformational/derivational frameworks which built on TG adopted some of
  the central ideas of RG, like the Unaccusative Hypothesis (section 3.7)

###.3.6.2 Case in Relational Grammar 36

* Georgian: a language with a complicated case marking system
  * how case and grammatical relations interact in a typical RG analysis
* analysed in great detail by Alice Harris (Harris 1981, 1984)
  * case patterns differ according to the tense/mood/aspect of the clause
  * dative inversion: subj is dat when the verb carries evidential marking
* dative and accusative in Georgian are not distinguished (a common cross-ling)
* within RG, the
  interplay between case and grammatical relations is not defined formally
  * partly because the relationship is not straightforward and
    involves semantic and further morphosyntactic factors, which
    go beyond representations of grammatical relations
* continues to be true for some syntactic theories
  (GB/Minimalism, HPSG, Combinatory Categorial Grammar),
* others have formulated explicit theories of linking to
  determine the interrelationship between case, grammatical relations,
  thematic roles and clausal semantics (chapter 5)

## 3.7 The Unaccusative Hypothesis 38

* played an important role in theories of lexical semantics and case
* verbs come in different flavours is well known
  * intransitive verbs such as fall, transitive verbs such as kick and ditrans
  * some verbs are with dative arguments and denote psychological experience
    eg Latin placēre ‘please’ (see chapter 2, exercise 1)
  * intransitive verbs can be divided into two major classes cross-linguistic
    * had been noted on a language-by-language basis
    * 1970s: universally valid generalization could be made about the two types
    * Fillmore (1968): two general formulas to derive intransitive frames
    * the single argument is an
      * agent and the subject is therefore more ‘active’, dubbed unergative
      * objective and therefore less ‘active’, unaccusative
* Perlmutter and Postal (1984:98–99) provide a list of examples for both types
  * Unerg: Willed or Volitional Acts, Manner of Speaking, Animal Sounds,
    Involuntary Bodily Processes
  * Unacc: Affected Argument, Inchoatives, Existing and Happening, Involuntary
    Emission of Stimuli
* unaccusatives act as if they have an underlying 2, ie an object/theme
* The terms unaccusatives and unergative are due to Geoffrey Pullum
  (Perlmutter and Postal 1984:95) and he proposed them on the following basis:
  ‘if a 1 in a stratum with a 2 is an ergative, a
    1 in a stratum with no 2 should be called an unergative 1, and likewise,
    if a 2 in a stratum with a 1 is an accusative, a
    2 in a stratum with no 1 should be called an unaccusative 2’ (Pullum 1991)
  * terminological confusion became even worse with Burzio (PhD 1981 = 1986)
    * call unaccusatives ‘ergative verbs’ (without providing reasoning)
* division into unaccusatives vs. unergatives has proved to be useful in
  * auxiliary selection in Romance and Germanic languages
  * impersonal passives, and ne-cliticization in Italian (Rosen 84, Burzio 86)
* Italian auxiliary selection
  * some intransitive verbs co-occur with the perfect auxiliary avere ‘have’
    while others require essere ‘be’. This contrast is illustrated in (42)
  * eg _has lavorato_ `has worked`, _è arrivato_ `ist arrived`
  * Transitive sentences always use ‘have’ unless they contain a reflexive
  * generalization: essere ‘be’ if 1-arc and an object-arc with the same head
* A similar pattern holds for languages like German and Dutch
  * semantic factors such as telicity play a role (Zaenen 1993)

## 3.8 The Universal Alignment Hypothesis 42

* some set of universal principles on the basis of which,
  given the semantic representation of a clause, one can
  predict which initial grammatical relation each nominal bears
* A (simplified) correspondence is shown in (48)

# 4 Structural Case

* thematic roles, and case,
  the fundamental ideas guiding a purely structural approach to gramm rels

## 4.1 The Structural View of Grammatical Relations 46

* the basic approach to case and valency within Government-Binding (GB) and the
  more recent versions of the theory, namely the Minimalist Program (MP)
  * literature is vast. The consensus on any particular analysis is minimal
  * => challenge to illustrate the basic ideas and assumptions comprehensively
    without also introducing the complete formal machinery and the various
    discussions which argue for or against a particular solution
* A fundamental assumption is that the grammatical relations & the thematic
  roles discussed in chapter 3 should be encoded structurally
  * Case marking per se relegated to the morphophonological component
    whose job it is to ‘spell out’ the structural relations
  * where this intuition comes from, and how it plays out, the next sections go
    through some of the pertinent historical developments

4.8 Structural vs. Inherent or Quirky Case

* so far: structural Case. This is defined as a property of a structural
  configuration and generally assigns nominative and accusative case
* further cases eg dative argument of ditransitive verbs in German
  * goal/beneficiary argument of a ditransitive verb is dative as in (41a)
  * very common crosslinguistic option
  * hE English, Italian and French, the languages which initially provided the
    bulk of the data for trafoal analyses, do not have a morphological dative

4.9 Taking Stock 71

* Widespread agreement on case is restricted to a small subset of the crosslin-
  guistic patterns: genitive for possessors in NPs, accusative for objects,
  nominative in subject position of a finite clause, and datives for secondary
  objects of ditransitives. The case on spatial and temporal adjuncts or
  arguments is connected to their semantics

# 5 Linking Theories

##5.1 Introduction 91

* Linking: generalizations in predicate-argument structures to a syntactic repr
  * relationship between lexical semantics, argument structure, case marking,
    grammatical relations and syntactic structure
* chapter begins with some
  * fundamental ideas about predicate-argument structure in relation to
    thematic relations, lexical decomposition and protoroles
  * differing linking theories
    * Kiparsky’s theory of case
    * Wunderlich’s Lexical-Decomposition Grammar (LDG)
    * LFG’s Mapping Theor.
  * Role and Reference Grammar deferred to chapter 8
    * reference to ergativity (chapter 6)

##5.6 Lexical Decomposition Grammar 111

* Wunderlich (1997) to account for argument and case patterns and argument al-
  ternations crosslinguistically
  * primarily a theory of linking and was inspired by Kiparsky’s linking theory
  * later it in turn informed the further development of Kiparsky’s theory
  * Kiparsky adopted the Semantic Form (SF) representation for argument struct
    * ultimately based on Bierwisch’s 1983 ideas

##5.8 Case Stacking 138
##5.9 An Interactive Model of Case 142

* Urdu alternations: subject alternation, or differential subject marking
  * form: only difference is the case morphology on one of the noun phrases
  * This morphological difference signals a difference in semantic interpret
    * ergative subj indicates that the participant (‘Nadya’) has some control
    * dative case in (107b) implies more of an obligation to perform the action
    * discussed in the Optimality Theoretic literature (section 8.2)
* Butt and King’s (1991) proposals for semantic case foreshadowed Nordlinger’s
  ideas about _constructive case_ (section 5.8) in that the
  * case markers themselves are active components which
    contribute to the analysis of a clause
  * The lexical entry for the accusative use of _ko_ states that:
    * the case is accusative;
    * the relevant NP should be a direct object;
    * the NP should be interpreted as specific at the level of s(emantic)-struc
* Based on data mainly from Urdu, Georgian and Russian, Butt and King went on
  * both a diachronic and a synchronic perspective, Butt and King (2003)
* The next few sections briefly present the essential points of the theory
  * Butt and King (2003) assume differing kinds of case:
    structural or default case (section 5.9.2),
    semantic case (section 5.9.4), and
    quirky case (section 5.9.3)
* The analysis makes full use of LFG’s projection architecture, including the
  semantic projection, as seen in (109), and the argument projection (a-struct)

5.9.2 Structural Case 145
5.9.3 Quirky Case 146
### 5.9.4 Semantic Case 146

* In Urdu and in most South Asian languages,
* semantic case is the most general type
* defining characteristics of semantic case in the sense of Butt and King are:
  * semantic predictability;
  * subjection to syntactic restrictions, such as being confined to certain
    grammatical functions, mostly one or two

##6.6 Split Ergativity 175
##6.7 Acquisition Issues 176

* ergativity as such poses no real problems for language acquisition
* languages that have been studied in the acquisition literature include
  * already discussed, namely, Hindi, Basque and West Greenlandic, as well as
  * not as yet been mentioned, namely K’iche’ (a Maya language),
    Kaluli (spoken in Papua New Guinea) and Samoan
* K’iche’ patterns along the lines of West Greenlandic, except that there are
  two phonologically conditioned versions of the ergative case. Pye (1990)
* two major hypotheses in language acquisition about the nature of the
  information the child uses to ‘bootstrap’ its grammar
  * syntactic boot-strapping hypothesis: built-in information about universal
  * semantic bootstrapping hypothesis: universal semantically based information
* Under both the syntactic and the semantic bootstrapping accounts, the
  ergative case works out to be problematic
* children pay attention to transitivity
  * articulated as transitivity by Hopper and Thompson (1980). Transitivity is
  * a fundamental human schema which involves
    situations in which an actor operates upon an object
  * can be expressed in a variety of ways and some
  * fundamental ingredients are volitionality or control over the action,
    telicity or completion of the action, the affectedness of the object, and
    the focus placed on the actor vs. the object, realis or irrealis mood, and
    punctuality of the action
    (compare these factors to Dowty’s Proto-Role entailments, section 5.4)
  * highly transitive if a high number of these ingredients are present
    (Slobin’s 1985 Manipulative Activity Scene)
* Budwig (1989) in her examination of six English-speaking children
  * my vs I expresses the notion of control
  * _My_ links up with utterances in which the child attempts to bring about a
    change in the environment, while
    _I_ appears in utterances where control is not at issue. [Budwig 1989:277]
* languages in which the ergative is not acquired as quickly or as easily as
  described above
  * hE, in these languages, there are some confounding factors
  * Samoan: ergative is grounded in sociolinguistic factors as well as syntax
    * The more formal reg requires the ergative on all postverbal trans sbj
    * The less formal register allows the ergative not to be expressed at all
* Kaluli: ergative is 
  * related to focus (partly encoded by word order) and kinship terms
  * identical in form to the genitive
  * children are correlating it with the use of the past tense
    * not found in the adult language
* Basque: the acquisition of the ergative turns out to be problematic
  (Ezeizabarrena and Larrañaga 1996, Larrañaga 2000)
  * because the ergative -k marker is identical to the absolutive plural -k
  * nL children do acquire the right verb agreement facts early on
  * they are attentive early on to the basic ergative pattern, though they may
    be struggling with the precise form of the case marker on the nouns

# 7 The Semantics of Case 188

* some further well known semantically based case alternations, and
* a variety of approaches, which contain a serious semantic component in their
  anal of case

## 7.1 Localist Theories 188

* ground patterns of case marking in concrete spatial and locational uses
* Abstract or temporal uses of case are argued to be derived from spatial uses
* both abstract and structural case marking are connected to a spatial use
* eg the Latin accusative marks objects, but [also] directional goals
* Localist theories assume that such accusatives of direction are not aberrant:
  * regular principles connect the abstract structural use with the directional
* English dative to: (2) Kim donated books to the library/walked to her house
  * Because the English to is a preposition and not a case morpheme, the
    parallel between the concrete spatial and the abstract use is more obvious
  * Recall that case morphology is often derived from former adpositions
  * connection between concrete spatial uses and abstract case is
    not far-fetched
  * is the connection as direct as what is assumed in Localist theories?
* long tradition. The first practitioner was the
  * Byzantine Maximus Planudes, who lived and worked around 1300 CE
  * Hjelmslev (1935) and J. Anderson (1971)
  * Jakobson’s (1936) effort to find coherent semantics for the Russian case
    eg all of the individual uses of the Russian genitive, should be derivable
    from one and the same overarching semantics
  * Gruber (1965) have found their way into much of modern linguistic thought,
    mostly by way of Jackendoff’s (1972, 1976, 1990) devel & formalization
  * modern generative approaches
    * not explicitly adopt a localist theory
    * fundamental ideas have nevertheless ‘leaked’ into ling consciousness
    * assumed as basic generalizations about how language works
      * eg subjects of psych predicates are abstract goals
* Localist theories seek to formalize these basic generalizations
  in order to drive linguistic explanations

## 7.2 Agency vs. Experience 189

* Wierzbicka (1981) ‘Case Marking and Human Nature’ takes a closer look
* Silverstein’s (1976) person hierarchy (see section 6.6)
  * humans see themselves as a ‘quintessential agent’ and that therefore
    1st and 2nd persons need to be less marked for agency than other things
  * With respect to ergativity this view predicts that
    1st and 2nd person pronouns will be marked less often with an overt erg,
    than 3rd person pronouns and nouns
  * This pattern is indeed confirmed by crosslinguistic comparison
  * Ergative marks an unexpected agent, Accusative marks an unexpected patient
* Wierzbicka rejects this view and instead argues ‘experiencerhood’/‘pathood’
  * humans instead are more worried about what is happening to them
  * ratios of agents to patients in plays
  * you are more interested in what other people are doing to you than vice ver
    * more sensitive to the ways in which other people’s actions affect him
    * regards himself as the quintessential ‘victim’ or experiencer
  * many languages have a special construction for marking experiencers
    * datives or genitives crosslinguistically
    * genitive subject for Bengali:
      I.Gen tea.Nom good be.attached.Pres
      ‘I like tea.’ (Klaiman 1980:276)
  * German involves the so-called ‘free dative’
    _Sei (mir) nur brav!_ ‘Be good!’
    * an experiencer dative and is not subcategorized for the verb
  * all cases must be seen as having a semantic connection and
    there must be a basic meaning for each case + a range of meanings derived
    * This echoes Jakobson’s (1936) ideas of how to analyse case
    * eg even the structural accusative must be invested with semantic content
      (beyond being used to mark patients or themes),
  * semantically determined case alternations. One pertinent example in (6)
    * Russian.  (6)
      Ivan ždet tramvaj(a)
      Ivan.Nom is-waiting-for tram.Acc/Gen
      ‘Ivan is waiting for the/a tram.’ (Wierzbicka 1982:56)
    * encountered for Urdu in section 5.9
    * quite common crosslinguistically, indicating that this is a systematic
* The next section explores several proposals with respect to such object alter
* Wierzbicka also implicates topicality and discourse as playing a role
  * particularly with respect to the ergative
  * there is little work on this and no ‘standard’ theory, see section 5.3

# 8 More Theories Great and Small

## 8.1 Role and Reference Grammar

* whether an approach that based itself on core data from Lakhota, Tagalog and
  Dyirbal, rather than Western + Hebrew, would differ substantially from the
  standard Chomskyan derivational/transformational tradition (Foley and Van
  Valin 1977, Van Valin 1977a,b). The answer to his question is ‘yes’
* a theory with many active practitioners today, international conferences, and
  summer schools
  * Much of the data that is analysed is the result of primary field work. As
  * there are several languages for which only RRG analyses exist.
  * Comprehensive discussions of the theory are presented in
    Van Valin (1993) and Van Valin and LaPolla (1997)
* inspired by Fillmore’s Case Grammar and rejects versions of X bar Theory
  * phrase structure in terms of layers of clause structure
    * nucleus is represented by the main predicate (eg the verb), the
    * core represents the core predication (verb plus arguments)
    * syntactic structure
* shares some characteristics with LFG: multidimensional
  * constituent projection (the basic tree), an
  * operator projection (tense, mood, aspect, etc.), and a
  * focus structure projection for discourse phenomena
* rejects the universal applicability of grammatical relations such as subject
  * Instead, relationship between macroroles and the
    Privileged Syntactic Argument (PSA)
* The PSA functions as the syntactic pivot of the clause (cf. section 6.4)
  * generalizations about agreement, control, or the coordinate reduction are
    stated with reference to the PSA and the macroroles
  * the syntactically ergative language Dyirbal the Undergoer macrorole is PSA
    * rather than the Actor macrorole as in German
* macroroles: Actor and Undergoer. These two roles generalize
  * similar to Dowty’s Proto-Roles (which were inspired by the previously
    existing idea of macroroles), see section 5.4
  * owes much to Gruber’s (1965) and Jackendoff’s (1976) original work
* detailed lexical semantic or Logical Structure (LS) representations as shown
  * follow Vendler’s (1967) original aktionsart classification 
  * in line with general assumptions about lexical decomposition (sec 4.10.3)
    * ingressive INGR denotes the beginning of a new event or state
    * BECOME denotes the entry into a new state (change of state)
    * difference between states and activities is a ‘do’ component, ie
      whether or not somebody is engaging in an activity, or whether they are
      simply continuing a given state
    * States and activities differ from achievements and accomplishments,
      accomplishments/achievements have/ne result states (a change of state is
      achieved or accomplished)
    * difference between achievements and accomplishments is one of duration:
      accomplishments are non-punctual
* As in Jackendoff’s (1990) approach, there is
  no direct representation of thematic roles in RRG
  * mapping or linking of semantic arguments to syntactic representations is
    mediated by the macroroles, as shown in (2)
* Actor-Undergoer Hierarchy. The semantic macroroles generalize
  * arguments of _do_ are preferably interpreted as Actor,
  * arguments of state predicates and second arguments of general predicates
    are preferably interpreted as Undergoer
* macroroles need to be linked to the PSA
  (which could be thought of as the single grammatical relation in RRG)
* consideration of case, agreement and word order
* The next few sections examine how some of the basic clause types discussed in
  this book are analysed within RRG

### 8.1.1 Basic Linking 205

transitives, passives, unaccusatives and unergatives

### 8.1.2 Ditransitives and Dative Subjects 208

* M-transitivity is defined in terms of the number of macroroles a verb can
  take (Van Valin and LaPolla 1997:150,355; Narasimhan 1998)
  * Verbs can lexically carry information about their M-transitivity in cases
    when it deviates from the semantic transitivity expected on the basis of
    their LS representations
* In German and Icelandic, the verbs for ‘help’ are assumed to be semantically
  transitive (two arguments in their LS), but M-intransitive
  * ie although there are two semantic arguments, which correspond to two
    syntactic arguments (‘Gaby/I’ and ‘dog/he’), there is
    only one macrorole available for linking
  * In _Gabi half dem Hund._, ‘Gaby’ correspond to the Actor macrorole and is
    assigned nominative by (5a). It also triggers verb agreement by (6)
  * The ‘dog’ and is left macroroleless and receive dative case by (5c)
