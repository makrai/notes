Theories of Case
2006 Cambridge University Press

* issues must be dealt with
  * what “case” really means
  * which historically motivated assumptions have served to form [the] notion
* This book is written primarily from a syntactic point of view
  * case as proposed within various theories of syntax
  * also touches on semantic and morphological issues along the way
* unbroken grammatical traditions ... back to the ancient Greek and Roman
  * contemporary of the Greek and Roman tradition was the Indian ... tradition,
    * dates back to at least Pānini’s grammar of Sanskrit (about 600 BCE)
    * remains current in much of Indian linguistic thought today
  * Arabic tradition [from] the formation of the Muslim Empire (about 700 CE)
* modern: a straightforward comparison across theories is doomed to fail
  * ‘case’ means different things to different people
  * this book focuses on a number of guiding themes which have been
    consistently associated with an analysis of case phenomena
    * semantic or thematic roles and the role of grammatical relations
    * The book abstracts away from detailed considerations of the morphophon
    * overt realization, how well do [each syntactic theory] deal with
* syntactic theories considered in this book are
  * Relational Grammar (RG)
  * Government and Binding (GB)
  * the Minimalist Program (MP) or Minimalism,
  * Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG)
  * Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). This does not exhaust the [theories]
* these are the theories [with] an active research interest in case per se

* The book is organized as follows
  * The remainder of this chapter takes the reader through some
    phenomena that have been associated with the notion of case. This
    * includes phenomena which everybody would agree that are indeed case,
    * others which upon closer inspection must be rejected as being ... case

## 1.2 What is Case? 3

* Languages may choose to encode this relationship either
  * structurally in terms of designated positions (e.g., English) or
  * via overt morphological markers
  * Icelandic or Bulgarian, however, are somewhat of a problem for this view
    * Icelandic employs both strategies simultaneously in that it combines a
      rather rigid word order with a fairly rich and complex case marking
      system (Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson 1985).  This would appear to be a
    * The opposite is true of Bulgarian, which has about as much case marking
      as English does (i.e., virtually none), but which allows quite some
      freedom in word order, unlike English. The
      * word order in Bulgarian is governed by discourse configurational
* remainder of this section [for] phenomena which continue to be problematic

### 1.2.1. Head vs. Dependent Marking 5

* case-bearing affixes are often historically derived from the incorporation of
  pronouns (e.g., Jelinek 1987 for Navajo), the two crossreferencing strategies

### 1.2.2. Is Everything Case? — Persian ezafe

### 1.2.3. Adverbial Case 6

* In both Korean and German, optional nonargument measure phrases appear in ACC

### 1.2.4. Case and Finiteness 7

* Case Resistance Principle (Stowell 1981)
  * finiteness and case marking are in complementary distribution. While
    * non-finite embedded clauses ... can be case marked, the corresponding
    * embedded finite clause in (10b) bears no case marking

### 1.2.5. Nominal Case 8

* will not figure much in this book is the treatment of the
* case marking on nominals which are licensed by other nominals. The
* standard case for this situation is the genitive, as in
  e.g. _John’s hat_  or _The destruction of the city._  The genitive has
* often ... a distinction is made between
  verbal predicates which license verbal case such as nominative and acc
  nominal predicates which license genitive case
  * hE in some languages verbal nouns allow arguments with either a nom or vbl
  * e.g. Japanese noun-verb complex predicates with suru ‘do’
    (Grimshaw and Mester 1988), whereby the
    * arguments can be either marked with the genitive or ... dative or acc
  * Urdu examples in (11) illustrate the same type of case marking alternation
    in conjunction with a verbal noun (infinitive)
  * Latin, dubbed the narrative infinitive is shown in (12). Here there is
    * no finite head of the sentence as the verb ‘resist’ is infinitive
    * (similar examples can be found in French and Russian) are therefore
* quirky subjects taken up later in the book: the notion of . In (11), the
  * e.g. subject ... marked with a dative. This is contrary to the expectations
  * Icelandic (Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson 1985) and such subjects have since

### 1.2.6. Case Stacking 9

* handed down from the Romans, is that each nominal should only bear one case
* Australian languages, which allow case stacking. 4 An example from
  * Kayardild is shown in (13). It illustrates the most extreme documented
  * case markers are also put to work as tense/mood/aspect markers in
    * C.OBL (complementizing oblique) indicates that this item is part of the
      embedded complement clause. The suffix glossed as
    * M.ABL is a modal ablative and marks the clause as having past tense
      (together with the finite verb). Both of these suffixes can be argued to
      be case markers (Evans 1995b) as their distribution and morphosyntactic
        Australian languages. The examples in (14) come from Kayardild (Evans
        1995a:107–108)
* The allative, modal proprietive, modal ablative and modal oblique all serve
  to express tense/aspect/mood distinctions. Note that this phenomenon is not

## 1.3 Levels of Abstractness

* case markers in the Urdu examples ... are case clitics
  * independent entities: can be separated by other elements e.g. focus clitics
* Furthermore, the English _to_ as in _I gave milk to the cat_ is generally
  interpreted as a dative case marker
  * syntactic status of preposition
* [abstract] notion of case [in syntax characterizes] the
  interaction between verbal lexical semantics,
  grammatical relations and word order
* I will nevertheless pose the question
  whether the theory has anything to say about a typology of ... case systems,
  * whether the theory worries about the determination of the overt form
  * not the most interesting point of comparison
    (because most of the theories have not given these issues much thought)
  * two other guiding themes
    * semantic or thematic roles and the postulation of grammatical relations
    * how are they expressed or encoded and what role do they play?
* each theory has found differing sets of phenomena of interest
* agreement seems to be that all theories should be able to account for
  basic transitives, ditransitives,
  unaccusatives vs. unergatives (section 3.7),
  passivization,
  quirky case (section 4.8) and
  ergativity (chapter 6)

# 2 Foundational Perspectives

## 2.1 Introduction 12

* case is from Latin cāsus, which is in turn a translation of the
  Greek ptōsis ‘fall’: falling away from an assumed standard form
* Sanskrit, around the 6th century BCE, generally attributed to Pānini
  * Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973)
  * relationship between semantic roles and case found in Pānini’s grammar
* three basic elements which will wend their way throughout the book:
  * the role of overt case marking;
  * semantic roles play an important part in the determination of case marking;
  * the realization: grammatical relations
* Hebrew and the Chinese traditions [not relevant for] modern theories of case

## 2.2 The Greek and Roman Tradition 13

* Aristarchos of Samothrake (217–145 BCE) who lived in Alexandria
  * his student, Dionysios Thrax (ca. 170–90 BCE), wrote a grammar of Greek
* Roman names for the cases are due to Remmius Palaemon: Ars Grammatica
  * mistake in translation: _aitiatike_ had several meanings
  * meaning intended by Thrax was that of affectedness, but the
    Roman translation picked up on the meaning of ‘accused’
  * dative is related to Latin dare ‘to give’
    * recipient, of an object or of a more abstract entity
  * vocative ... is related to Latin vocāre ‘to call, summon’
* Sanskrit tradition, where the case markers were simply numbered, [no sem]
* assumption that case must be tied directly to semantics is
  * still implicit in [the descriptions of] previously undescribed languages
  * made explicit in modern Localist Theories of case and semantic roles (see
    section 7.1 for some discussion), which go back to Gruber (1965)
  * spatial notions are fundamental to our conceptualization of events and
    therefore also to the participants in events
* Tékhnē dealt with locative associations of three cases:
  genitive of origin, dative of location and accusative of direction. In
  * Byzantine times, the grammarian Maximus Planudes (ca. 1300) dealt with this
  * Hjelmslev (1935:10–12) to see Planudes as the first propounder of a truly
    localist theory of case (Robins 2000:420)
  * found their way into mainstream syntax via ... Jackendoff (1972, 1990)
    * lexical decomposition, discussed in chapter 5
* Greek and Roman linguistic tradition furnished modern linguistics with
  * basic case terminology
  * the type of case marking in Greek and Latin is taken to be basic
    * case is (pretheoretically) often associated with [that] type of semantics
  * often unquestioned
  * recurring discussion in the chapters to come

## 2.3 The Indian Tradition 15

* more complicated relationship between case and semantics is assumed
* Pānini’s grammar of Sanskrit (approximately 6th century BCE)
  * not clear whether one person wrote the grammar, or [a school]
* grammar, known as the Astādhyāyı̄, is a study in compactness and clever coding
  * 4000 interdependent rules,
    ordered mostly by the type of topic addressed and the level of generality
  * more general or default rules are couched so that they may be overridden
  * Without any commentary, the rules come to about 30 printed pages
  * couched extremely compactly in a linguistic metalanguage
  * cases are simply numbered in this grammar. This avoids the prejud assoc
* Pānini was aware of a number of semantic factors which played a role
  * Kāraka Theory: interaction between verbal lexical semantics and
    a theory of semantic roles (Kāraka = doer)
  * semantic roles are defined explicitly as part of the grammar

|apādāna	    |the fixed point from which something recedes (ablative)	|
|sam.pradāna	|the item in view through the karman (goal)	              |
|karan.a	    |the most effective means (instrument)	                  |
|adhikaran.a	|locus, location (locative)	                              |
|karman	      |the thing desired by the agent (patient)	                |
|kartr.	      | the independent one (agent)	                            |

* The possible lexical semantic environments are specified in the grammar by
  ... reference to particular verb classes or a simple listing
  * e.g.  ‘The locus is karman (patient)
  with the verbs śı̄N . ‘lie’, sthā ‘stand’, ās ‘sit’, when preceded by
  adhi (preverb meaning roughly ‘above’, ‘over’, ‘on’, ‘on to’).’
* other rules which govern the overt realization of case
* effect of this interacting system of rules: no simple one-to-one
  correspondence between semantic roles and case marking
  * unlike what is assumed in much of standard linguistic theory today
* no terminological classifications to describe [deviating] patterns
  * e.g. the accusative of direction or the genitive of origin

## 2.4 The Arabic Tradition 18

* founded in the 8th century CE in the context of an expanding Islamic
* Sı̄bawaihi (d. 793 CE) is credited [as the first on] general linguistic princ
* grammar is known as Al-Kit āb (the book) and functioned as
  a model for all subsequent grammars, just as was the case in the Greek/Roman
  and Indian traditions. Sı̄bawaihi’s Al-Kit āb indeed continues to be looked to
* interest in grammar arose as part of larger religious concerns
* syntactic questions are followed by derivational morphology and finally,
  phonology and phonetics
* includes a discussion of case marking, government, and
  a concomitant [kísérő] notion of reconstruction
  * somewhat reminiscent of ideas in modern linguistic theory (Lechner 1998)
* Arabic is a VSO language
  * accusative (nas. b), genitive (jarr) and nominative (raf‘),
    associated with the underlying vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/, respectively
* Case is [in the Arabic tradition] embedded within a larger theory of governmn
  * governors (‘ āmil) such as verbs, prepositions or nominals
    determine the form of a governed element (ma‘ c mūl)
* [in the theo,] An element cannot have more than one governor and
  no phrasal element may intervene between the governor and the governed
  * grammatical relations ... do not always have to be expressed by an overt NP
    [but] as part of the verbal morphology. In (9b) the subject is
    represented by the 3rd singular morphology on the verb ‘see’
  * differentiation between an underlying and a surface level of speech
  * underlying level of representation which included a copy of the verb
* relation between active sentences, passivization, and causativization
  * Sı̄bawaihi: neither could be seen as being derived from the other
  * majority of Arabic grammarians (after Sı̄bawaihi) held that the
    passive was to be derived from an underlying active form and that the
    causative ... in a complementary relation to the passive, as shown in (14)

## 3.1 The Structure of Sentences 23

* [20th century e.g.]
  * syntactic interplay between negation, question words and auxiliaries, or
  * identification of syntactic effects due to elements not visible
* Zellig Harris’ book Structural Linguistics (1951) shows
  * each linguistic entity (element or construction) as composed out of
    specified ordered entities at a lower level
  * A language is then described as consisting of
    specified sets of kernel sentences and a set of transformations
  * transformations either by modifying the kernel sentences of a given set
    or by combining them (in fixed ways) with other kernel sentences
* Noam Chomsky, whose 1957 book Syntactic Structures had a huge impact
* computational concerns. In the wake of World War II
  * vast experience gathered with code cracking
  * machine translation system ... in order to ‘crack’ Russian
* context-free phrase structure rules provided an elegant way of dealing with
  * language is potentially capable of producing strings of infinite length;
  * context does not always matter
* transformations [continue to permeate] ideas about case, argument structure
  and grammatical relations

## 3.2 Transformational Grammar, Case and the Passive 24

* transformations was initially [in] Harris (1957) and Chomsky (1957)
* first generation of Chomsky’s students at MIT, the influential theory of
  Transformational Grammar (TG) truly began to take off
* idea was to derive all possible sentences of a given language
  from a set of basic structures
  * One central transformation was one which derived a passive structure
  * transformation is very specific to English
  * absolutely no mention of case [in spite of I/me]
* comparison between this approach and the view within Arabic linguistics
  * also assumed that the passive was derived from a basic active clause
  * included an explicit statement about case: the passivization of an active
    * transformation of an accusative object into a nominative subject
* extensive debates in the 1970s prompted by
  * language specific character of many of the transformations proposed
  * unconstrained nature
  * Lakoff (1971) and McCawley (1972) showed that the use of
    disjunctive possibilites within transformations resulted in a
    loss of generalization and that the kinds of transformations
    permitted an application to arbitrary sets of categories
    (see Bresnan 1977 for a good discussion of the issues at stake)
* Another deep concern was [to interface with the new] field of formal sem
  * things [that] pattern together semantically, but were being
    treated syntactically via several different transformations
* more constrained and very successful theo: Government-Binding (see chapter 4)

## 3.4 The Notion of Grammatical Relations 28

* Chomsky (1965:71) includes a structural definition of the grammatical rels
  * structural categorization remains a part of the modern descendants of TG
  * no mention of case, nor is there room for an indirect object
  * To date, the indirect object remains somewhat of an anomaly [in this trad],
* Case Theory emerged in the revised version of the theory known as GB

* relationships needed for crosslinguistic analysis include at the very least:

  * grammatical relations (the so-called ‘term’ relations)

  * lower ranked non-term relations include both
    * oblique relations (corresponding roughly to adjuncts) and the

* some kinds of clauses are considered to be more basic than other kinds. For
  e.g. passivization [applies] universally to a [network with] a 1 and a 2 arc

  * For example, take the general
    * 1-Advancement Exclusiveness Law in (24)
      * constraints on the ... advancement within a given network
      * Advancement rules allow a 2 or 3 node in ... to advance to a higher int

    * Final 1 Law in (27): each clause must contain a subject in the final
* transformational/derivational frameworks which built on TG [adopted] some of
  the central ideas of RG, like the Unaccusative Hypothesis (section 3.7)

###.3.6.2 Case in Relational Grammar 36

* Georgian: a language with a complicated case marking system
  * how case and grammatical relations interact in a typical RG analysis
* analysed in great detail by Alice Harris (Harris 1981, 1984)
  * case patterns differ according to the tense/mood/aspect of the clause
  * dative inversion: subj is dat when the verb carries evidential marking
* dative and accusative in Georgian are not distinguished (a common cross-ling)
* within RG, the 
  interplay between case and grammatical relations is not defined formally
  * partly because the relationship ... is not straightforward and 
    involve[s] semantic and further morphosyntactic factors, which 
    go beyond representations of grammatical relations
* continues to be true for some syntactic theories 
  (GB/Minimalism, HPSG, Combinatory Categorial Grammar),
* others have formulated explicit theories of linking to determine the
  interrelationship between case, grammatical relations, thematic roles and
  clausal semantics (chapter 5)

## 3.7 The Unaccusative Hypothesis 38

* played an important role in theories of lexical semantics and case
* verbs come in different flavours is well known: one can distinguish between
  * intransitive verbs such as fall, transitive verbs such as kick and ditrans
  * some verbs are [with dative arguments and] denote ... psychological experin
    e.g. Latin placēre ‘please’ (see chapter 2, exercise 1).  
  * intransitive verbs can be divided into two major classes cross-linguistic
    * had ... been noted on a language-by-language basis, but it did not become
    * 1970s: universally valid generalization could be made about the two types 
    * Fillmore (1968) posited two general formulas to derive intransitive frams
    * the single argument is an 
      agent and the subject is therefore more ‘active’, dubbed unergative
      objective and therefore less ‘active’, unaccusative
* Perlmutter and Postal (1984:98–99) provide a list of examples for both types
  * Unerg: Willed or Volitional Acts, Manner of Speaking, Animal Sounds,
    Involuntary Bodily Processes
  * Unacc: Affected Argument, Inchoatives, Existing and Happening, Involuntary
    Emission of Stimuli
* unaccusatives act as if they have an underlying 2, i.e., an object/theme
* The terms [unaccusatives and unergative] are due to Geoffrey Pullum
  (Perlmutter and Postal 1984:95) and he proposed them on the following basis:
  ‘if a 1 in a stratum with a 2 is an ergative, a 
    1 in a stratum with no 2 should be called an unergative 1, and likewise, 
    if a 2 in a stratum with a 1 is an accusative, a 
    2 in a stratum with no 1 should be called an unaccusative 2’ (Pullum 1991).
  * terminological confusion became even worse with Burzio (PhD 1981 = 1986)
    * call unaccusatives ‘ergative verbs’ (without providing reasoning). It
* division ... into unaccusatives vs. unergatives has proved to be useful in
  * auxiliary selection in Romance and Germanic languages, the use of
  * impersonal passives, and ne-cliticization in Italian (Rosen 84, Burzio 86).
* [Italian] auxiliary selection is discussed.  
  * some intransitive verbs co-occur with the perfect auxiliary avere ‘have’
    while others require essere ‘be’. This contrast is illustrated in (42).
  * e.g. _ha lavorato_ `has worked`, _è arrivato_ `ist arrived` 
  * Transitive sentences always use ‘have’ unless they contain a reflexive
  * generalization: essere ‘be’ [if] 1-arc and an object-arc with the same head
* A similar pattern ... holds for languages like German and Dutch, though in
  * semantic factors such as telicity play a role (Zaenen 1993)
