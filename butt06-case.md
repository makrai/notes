* issues must be dealt with. One is the issue of 
  * what “case” really means
  * which historically motivated assumptions have served to form [the] notion
* This book is written primarily from a syntactic point of view and therefore
  * case as proposed within various theories of syntax, unavoidably, however,
  * also touches on semantic and morphological issues along the way
* unbroken grammatical traditions ... back to the ancient Greek and Roman
  * contemporary of the Greek and Roman tradition was the Indian ... tradition,
    * dates back to at least Pānini’s grammar of Sanskrit (about 600 BCE)
    * remains current in much of Indian linguistic thought today
  * Arabic tradition, 
    * grew out of the formation of the Muslim Empire (about 700 CE). The book
* modern: a straightforward comparison across theories is doomed to fail. This
  * ‘case’ means different things to different people.  Indeed, a survey of all
  * this book focuses on a number of guiding themes which have been
    consistently associated with an analysis of case phenomena. Among these,
    * semantic or thematic roles and the role of grammatical relations in
    * The book abstracts away from detailed considerations of the morphophon
    * how well do [each syntactic theory] deal with the overt realization?
* syntactic theories considered in this book are 
  * Relational Grammar (RG)
  * Government and Binding (GB)
  * the Minimalist Program (MP) or Minimalism, 
  * Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG)
  * and Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). This does not exhaust the number of
* these are the theories [with] an active research interest in case per se. A
* chapter is devoted to various types of linking theories, which seek to
  * generalizations between overt case marking, argument structure and

* The book is organized as follows. 
  * The remainder of this chapter takes the reader through some 
    phenomena that have been associated with the notion of case. This 
    * includes phenomena which everybody would agree that are indeed case,
    * others which upon closer inspection must be rejected as being ... case

## 1.2 What is Case? 3

* Languages may choose to encode this relationship either 
  * structurally in terms of designated positions (e.g., English) or 
  * via overt morphological markers.  Languages like 
  * Icelandic or Bulgarian, however, are somewhat of a problem for this view
    * Icelandic employs both strategies simultaneously in that it combines a
      rather rigid word order with a fairly rich and complex case marking
      system (Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson 1985).  This would appear to be a
    * The opposite is true of Bulgarian, which has about as much case marking
      as English does (i.e., virtually none), but which allows quite some
      freedom in word order, unlike English. The 
      * word order in Bulgarian is governed by discourse configurational
* remainder of this section [for] phenomena which continue to be problematic

### 1.2.1. Head vs. Dependent Marking 5

* case-bearing affixes are often historically derived from the incorporation of
  pronouns (e.g., Jelinek 1987 for Navajo), the two crossreferencing strategies

### 1.2.2. Is Everything Case? — Persian ezafe
### 1.2.3. Adverbial Case 6

* In both Korean and German, optional nonargument measure phrases appear in ACC

### 1.2.4. Case and Finiteness 7

* Case Resistance Principle (Stowell 1981)
  * finiteness and case marking are in complementary distribution. While 
    * non-finite embedded clauses ... can be case marked, the corresponding
    * embedded finite clause in (10b) bears no case marking

### 1.2.5. Nominal Case 8

* will not figure much in this book is the treatment of the 
* case marking on nominals which are licensed by other nominals. The 
* standard case for this situation is the genitive, as in 
  e.g. _John’s hat_  or _The destruction of the city._  The genitive has
* often ... a distinction is made between 
  verbal predicates which license verbal case such as nominative and acc
  nominal predicates which license genitive case
  * hE in some languages verbal nouns allow arguments with either a nom or vbl
  * e.g. Japanese noun-verb complex predicates with suru ‘do’ 
    (Grimshaw and Mester 1988), whereby the 
    * arguments can be either marked with the genitive or ... dative or acc
  * Urdu examples in (11) illustrate the same type of case marking alternation
    in conjunction with a verbal noun (infinitive)
  * Latin, dubbed the narrative infinitive is shown in (12). Here there is 
    * no finite head of the sentence as the verb ‘resist’ is infinitive
    * (similar examples can be found in French and Russian) are therefore
* quirky subjects taken up later in the book: the notion of . In (11), the
  * e.g. subject ... marked with a dative. This is contrary to the expectations
  * Icelandic (Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson 1985) and such subjects have since

### 1.2.6. Case Stacking 9

* handed down from the Romans, is that each nominal should only bear one case
* Australian languages, which allow case stacking. 4 An example from 
  * Kayardild is shown in (13). It illustrates the most extreme documented
  * case markers are also put to work as tense/mood/aspect markers in
    * C.OBL (complementizing oblique) indicates that this item is part of the
      embedded complement clause. The suffix glossed as 
    * M.ABL is a modal ablative and marks the clause as having past tense
      (together with the finite verb). Both of these suffixes can be argued to
      be case markers (Evans 1995b) as their distribution and morphosyntactic
        Australian languages. The examples in (14) come from Kayardild (Evans
        1995a:107–108)
* The allative, modal proprietive, modal ablative and modal oblique all serve
  to express tense/aspect/mood distinctions. Note that this phenomenon is not
  * Finnish have also been implicated in this type of case usage.  The
* discussed again from the perspective of a formal analysis in chapter 8.  The

## 1.3 Levels of Abstractness

* case markers in the Urdu examples, on the other hand, are case clitics. This
  * independent entities to the extent that they can be separated
    by other elements such as focus clitics
* Furthermore, the English _to_ as in _I gave milk to the cat_ is generally
  interpreted as a dative case marker. This to is neither an inflection, nor a
  * syntactic status of preposition
* [abstract] notion of case [in syntax characterizes] the 
  interaction between verbal lexical semantics, 
  grammatical relations and word order. The overt realization of case must be
* I will nevertheless pose the question 
  whether the theory has anything to say about a typology of ... case systems,
  * whether the theory worries about the determination of the overt form of
  * not the most interesting point of comparison (because most of the theories
    have not given these issues much thought), the book mainly focuses on 
  * two other guiding themes, namely the use of 
    semantic or thematic roles and the postulation of grammatical relations
    * how are they expressed or encoded and what role do they play?
* each theory has found differing sets of phenomena of interest by virtue of
* agreement seems to be that all theories should be able to account for 
  basic transitives, ditransitives, 
  unaccusatives vs. unergatives (section 3.7), 
  passivization, 
  quirky case (section 4.8) and 
  ergativity (chapter 6)

# 2 Foundational Perspectives

## 2.1 Introduction 12

* case is from Latin cāsus, which is in turn a translation of the 
  Greek ptōsis ‘fall’: falling away from an assumed standard form
* Sanskrit, around the 6th century BCE and is generally attributed to Pānini
  * Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973). Particularly relevant for this book
  * relationship between semantic roles and case found in Pānini’s grammar
* three basic elements which will wend their way throughout the book: 
  * the role of overt case marking; 
  * semantic roles play an important part in the determination of case marking; 
  * the realization: grammatical relations
* Hebrew and the Chinese traditions ... did not include perspectives which are
  directly relevant to a discussion of modern theories of case

## 2.2 The Greek and Roman Tradition 13

* Aristarchos of Samothrake (217–145 BCE) who lived in Alexandria and thought
  his student, Dionysios Thrax (ca. 170–90 BCE), wrote a grammar of Greek
* Roman names for the cases are due to Remmius Palaemon: Ars Grammatica (1st
  * mistake in translation: aitiatike had several meanings. 
  * meaning intended by Thrax was that of affectedness, but the 
    Roman translation picked up on the meaning of ‘accused’, hence the modern
  * dative is related to Latin dare ‘to give’
    * recipient, of an object or of a more abstract entity. The 
  * vocative ... is related to Latin vocāre ‘to call, summon’
* Sanskrit tradition, where the case markers were simply numbered, [no sem]
  associated directly with some kind of semantic import
* assumption that case must be tied directly to semantics is 
  * still implicit in [the descriptions of] previously undescribed languages
  * made explicit in modern Localist Theories of case and semantic roles (see
    section 7.1 for some discussion), which go back to Gruber (1965). These
  * spatial notions are fundamental to our conceptualization of events and
    therefore also to the participants in events.  Event participants are
* Tékhnē dealt with locative associations of three cases: 
  genitive of origin, dative of location and accusative of direction. In
  * Byzantine times, the grammarian Maximus Planudes (ca. 1300) dealt with this
  * Hjelmslev (1935:10–12) to see Planudes as the first propounder of a truly
    localist theory of case (Robins 2000:420)
  * found their way into mainstream syntax via ... Jackendoff (1972, 1990) in
    * lexical decomposition, discussed in chapter 5. With respect to this
* [how] Greek and Roman linguistic tradition furnished modern linguistics with
  * basic case terminology — it also 
  * the type of case marking in Greek and Latin is taken to be basic and in
  * case is (pretheoretically) often associated with the type of semantics
    established by the Greeks and Romans. The precise import of the
  * often unquestioned
  * recurring discussion in the chapters to come

## 2.3 The Indian Tradition 15

* more complicated relationship between case and semantics is assumed
* Pānini’s grammar of Sanskrit (approximately 6th century BCE)
  * not clear whether one person wrote the grammar, or [a school]
* grammar, known as the Astādhyāyı̄, is a study in compactness and clever coding
  * 4000 interdependent rules, 
    ordered mostly by the type of topic addressed and the level of generality
  * more general or default rules are couched so that they may be overridden
  * Without any commentary, the rules come to about 30 printed pages
  * couched extremely compactly in a linguistic metalanguage
  * cases are simply numbered in this grammar. This avoids the prejud assoc
* Pānini was aware of a number of semantic factors which played a role
  * Kāraka Theory: interaction between verbal lexical semantics and 
    a theory of semantic roles (Kāraka = doer)
  * semantic roles are defined explicitly as part of the grammar

|apādāna	    |the fixed point from which something recedes (ablative)	|
|sam.pradāna	|the item in view through the karman (goal)	              |
|karan.a	    |the most effective means (instrument)	                  | 
|adhikaran.a	|locus, location (locative)	                              |
|karman	      |the thing desired by the agent (patient)	                |
|kartr.	      | the independent one (agent)	                            |

* The possible lexical semantic environments are specified in the grammar by
  ... reference to particular verb classes or a simple listing
  * e.g.  ‘The locus is karman (patient) 
  with the verbs śı̄N . ‘lie’, sthā ‘stand’, ās ‘sit’, when preceded by 
  adhi (preverb meaning roughly ‘above’, ‘over’, ‘on’, ‘on to’).’ 
* other rules which govern the overt realization of case
* effect of this interacting system of rules: no simple one-to-one
  correspondence between semantic roles and case marking
  * unlike what is assumed in much of standard linguistic theory today 
* no terminological classifications to describe [deviating] patterns which are
  * e.g. the accusative of direction or the genitive of origin

## 2.4 The Arabic Tradition 18

* founded in the 8th century CE in the context of an expanding Islamic
* Sı̄bawaihi (d. 793 CE) is credited with having developed the first com-
* grammar is known as Al-Kit āb (the book) and functioned as a model for all
  subsequent grammars, just as was the case in the Greek/Roman and Indian
  traditions. Sı̄bawaihi’s Al-Kit āb indeed continues to be looked to as an
* interest in grammar arose as part of larger religious concerns. The lan-
* syntactic questions are followed by derivational morphology and finally,
  phonology and phonetics. The grammatical tradition 
* includes a discussion of case marking, government, and 
  a concomitant [kísérő] notion of reconstruction 
  * somewhat reminiscent of ideas in modern linguistic theory (Lechner 1998)
* Arabic is a VSO language, i.e., a language in which the verb is sentence ini-
  * accusative (nas. b), genitive (jarr) and nominative (raf‘), associated
    with the underlying vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/, respectively
* Case is [in the Arabic tradition] embedded within a larger theory of governmn
  * governors (‘ āmil) such as verbs, prepositions or nominals 
    determine the form of a governed element (ma‘ c mūl).  (9) a. qāla zayd-un
* [in the theo,] An element cannot have more than one governor and 
  no phrasal element may intervene between the governor and the governed
  * grammatical relations ... do not always have to be expressed by an overt NP
    [but] as part of the verbal morphology. In (9b) the subject is
    represented by the 3rd singular morphology on the verb ‘see’
  * differentiation between an underlying and a surface level of speech. In
  * underlying level of representation which included a copy of the verb. (10)
* relation between active sentences, passivization, and causativization. The
  passive and causative of (11) are shown in
  * Sı̄bawaihi: neither could be seen as being derived from the other. However,
  * majority of Arabic grammarians (after Sı̄bawaihi) held that the passive was
    to be derived from an underlying active form and that the 
    causative ... in a complementary relation to the passive, as shown in (14)

## 3.2 Transformational Grammar, Case and the Passive 24

* transformations was initially [in] Harris (1957) and Chomsky (1957). When
  * the first generation of Chomsky’s students at MIT, the influential theory
    of Transformational Grammar (TG) truly began to take off
* idea was to derive all possible sentences of a given language 
  from a set of basic structures. That is, language was thought to consist of a
  * One central transformation was one which derived a passive structure 
  * transformation is very specific to English, including references to the
  * absolutely no mention of case. Given that English does not have very much
* comparison between this approach and the view within Arabic linguistics
  * also assumed that the passive was derived from a basic active clause
  * included an explicit statement about case: the passivization of an active
    * transformation of an accusative object into a nominative subject
* language specific character of many of the transformations proposed [and]
  unconstrained nature prompted extensive debates in the 1970s. Researchers
  * Lakoff (1971) and McCawley (1972) showed that the use of 
    disjunctive possibilites within transformations resulted in a 
    loss of generalization and that the kinds of transformations 
    permitted an application to arbitrary sets of categories 
    (see Bresnan 1977 for a good discussion of the issues at stake). 
* Another deep concern was [to interface with the new] field of formal sem
  (Montague 1973). The question was: If certain things were shown to pattern
  together semantically, but were being treated syntactically via several
  different transformations 
* more constrained and very successful theory of syntax which became known as
  Government-Binding or GB (see chapter 4)
