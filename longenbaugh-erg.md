Experimental approaches to ergative languages
Nicholas Longenbaugh and Maria Polinsky

* three major topics
  * competition between accusative and ergative alignment, where researchers
    have attempted to derive the typological preference for accusative
    alignment from _processing- and learnability-based constraints_
  * long-distance dependencies and agreement. The unique dissociation of case
    and argument-hood in ergative languages has afforded researchers new means
    of testing conclusions regarding the privileged grammatical status of
    subject,
  * areas for future research
