# Abstract

* we compare recorded sense numbers among a sample of headwords in a
  comprehensive Swedish monolingual dictionary with induced sense numbers for
  the same words in a Swedish corpus. We propose this as a simple technique to
  find words to prioritize for post-hoc manual checks, which can be done in a
  simple Online-User-Interface bypassing the need for programming knowledge. We
  perform a thorough manual evaluation of the proposed methodology enabling us
  to show statistically that using automatic WSI increases the odds of finding
  non-recorded senses compared to a random selection of words. We further (i)
  evaluate predictions according to potential inclusion in the dictionary
  providing strong evidence for usefulness in practical lexicography, and (ii)
  analyze model predictions in-depth to point towards future improvements. We,
  finally, integrate lessons learned from our analysis into a large-scale
  prediction effort, providing the first high-quality large-scale WSI
  predictions for Swedish. These are a valuable resource for future research in
  Swedish lexicography.
