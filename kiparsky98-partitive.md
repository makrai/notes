* organization:
  * 3 (and 4?) two recent theories of partitive case marking.
  * 5-7: an alternative account of Finnish
  * 8: sketch out the path and causes of its evolution from the old system

# 1 Partitive case as a syntactic and semantic problem

* two types of case, STRUCTURAL and INHERENT (or LEXICAL ) case (Chomsky 1981),
  similar to the older distinction between
  GRAMMATICAL and SEMANTIC case (Kuryłowicz 1964)
  * Structural case: assigned at S-structure in a purely configurational way,
  * inherent case is assigned at D-structure in
            possible dependence on the governing predicates’s lexical properties
  * not all cases fall cleanly into this typology. In particular, there is
  * a class of cases that pattern syntactically with the structural cases, but
    are semantically conditioned. These cases however
    * depend on different semantic conditions than inherent cases do: instead of
    * inherent is sensitive to the thematic relation that the NP bears to the
    * hybrid id sensitive to the NP’s definiteness, animacy, or quantificational
      properties, or to the aspectual character of the VP, or to some
      combination of these factors
    * The Finnish partitive is a particularly clear instance of this apparently
      hybrid category of semantically conditioned structural case. 2
* two functions of partitive
  * aspectual function: assigned to the objects of verbs which denote an
    unbounded event, in a sense to be made clear below. In its
  * NP-related function, partitive case is assigned to quantitatively indetermi-
    nate NPs (including indefinite bare plurals and mass nouns),
    even if the verb denotes a bounded event. Moreover, in
* Slavic, the distinction between
  perfective and imperfective aspect has the very same two functions (among oth)
* How can these functions be unified? And how can case, a nominal category,
  express the same meanings as the verbal category of aspect?
* typological perspective,
  the accusative/partitive case alternation in Finnish is intriguing because its
  * aspectual side resembles the so-called
    conative case alternation between accusative and dative objects found in
    Australian and Polynesian languages, among others
    (Hale 1982, Laughren 1988, Simpson 1991).  The
    * similarity: semantic effect of the two case alternations, and
      the class of verbs that participate in them
* conative dative also seems to straddle the distinction between struct vs inher
  * The dative object is syntactically transitive in many respects, yet the
    conative has been argued to be a kind of antipassive construction,
    attributed by some linguists to NP-movement in the syntax,
    by others to the operation of a lexical rule at the level of argument struct
* historical aspect to the partitive
  * the subject of much debate among Finno-Ugrists
  * originated as a purely adverbial local case with the meaning “from”. It
  * developed first its NP-related functions, in several stages
  * aspectual function was the last to emerge
  * extension steps related to shift from a semantic case to a structural case?
* In this paper I put forward an analysis of the Finnish partitive which sheds
  * The function of partitive case is to license unboundedness at the VP level.
  * This unifies the aspectual and NP-related functions of the partitive
    at the level of the VP, and appropriately
    generalizes to the conative constructions
  * By separating
    the configurational assignment of structural case at S-structure from
    its semantic conditioning, we
    preserve the spirit of the distinction between structural and semantic case.
  * The origin of the structural partitive can then be seen as a
    grammaticalization process of the classic type.

# 2 The semantics of partitive case 2

* The Finnish partitive has two functions, which can be termed
  ASPECTUAL and NPRELATED 
* aspectual function, which Finnish linguists have
  * characterized in terms of
    resultativity (Itkonen 1976, Hakulinen and Karlsson 1979, Larjavaara 1991)
    boundedness (Ikola 1961, Heinämäki 1984, Leino 1991), is illustrated in
(1) a. shoot-Pst-1Sg bear-Part / two-Part bear-Part  / bear-Pl-Part rálő
    b. shoot–Pst-1Sg bear-Acc  / two-Acc bear-Part   / bear-PlAcc   lelő
* eg shoot assigns case to their objects in two different ways, with
  a different aspectual interpretation. 3
  * irresultative, unbounded version (1a), the verb has a partitive object, and
    denotes an activity (in Vendler’s sense), “to shoot at”. In the aspectually
    * non-committal as to what happened to the bear, and its use
      conversationally implicates that the shot(s) missed.
  * resultative, bounded version (1b), it has an accusative object, and
    denotes an accomplishment, “to shoot dead”. 4 In contrast, the unbounded
* Finnish has verbs which are intrinsically
* The majority of Finnish verbs are either/or
  * unbounded, such as “love”, “seek”, and “touch”, and verbs which are
  * bounded, such as “kill”, “get”, “find”.
* the NP-related function of partitive case,
  consider an intrinsically
  * bounded verb such as saada “get”.
    * The objects of such verbs are
      partitive when they are quantitatively indeterminate (in particular, when
      they are indefinite bare plurals or mass nouns), otherwise accusative:
      (2) a.  get-1Sg bear-Part / #two-Part bear-Part / #bear-Pl-Part kapom/k medvéből
          b.  get-1Sg bear-Acc /   two-Acc bear-Part /   bear-PlAcc   kapom/k medvét
    * `#`: OK with ‘bear’ understood as a mass noun (meat), viz. ‘I own bear’.
    * the partitive in effect marks the indefiniteness of bare plural or mass noun
      objects (a more precise formulation will be given later).
  * unbounded verbs, on the other hand, assign partitive case to ALL their objs.
    With such a verb, a partitive bare plural object is
    ambiguous between a definite reading and an indefinite reading:
    (3) a.  seek-1Sg  bear-Part / two-Part bear-Part / bear-Pl-Part keresem/k medvére
        b.  seek-1Sg #bear-Acc / #two-Acc bear-Part / #bear-PlAcc   keresem/k medvét
* verbs such as ampua “shoot, shoot at” they share both of these patterns. With
  * a partitive bare plural object therefore yields a threeway ambiguity: 
    irresu-unbound V def N, resu-bound V indef, irresu-unbound V indef N
* so far, boundedness coincides with resultativity
  * One might be led to the conclusion that
    * bounded predicates are simply those that denote an accomplishment or achie
    * unbounded predicates are those that denote states and activities (process)
  * hE, resultativity is not the decisive criterion. A class of
  * bounded irresultative verbs, such as omistaa “own”, nähdä “see”,
  * assign case like resultative verbs: 6
    * though “own” is non-resultative like “seek”, it assigns case like
      achievement/accomplishment predicates such as “get”.  
    (4) a.  own-1Sg #bear-Part / #two-Part bear-Part / bear-Pl-Part
                                                           birtoklom/k medvékből
        b.  own-1Sg bear-Acc / two-Acc bear-Part / bear-PlAcc 
* building an intuition about the category of boundedness which determines the
  case marking of the object in Finnish
  * A predicate is intrinsically unbounded if it
    can be modified by degree adverbs such as (some) more, a lot, very much, a
    bit, somewhat less, considerably, slightly, referring to the extent of a
  * gradability of the event
  * bounded predicates, whether telic or atelic, admit of no degree. However,
    * can still receive an unbounded interpretation as a result of a
      durative/iterative reading induced by adverbs or other means
    * Such readings can also induce partitive case (e.g.  reading (3) of (11b)
      below, and section 6). 
(5/6) * Un/bounded verbal predicates:
  a. The sportsman shot at/killed a bear some more.
  b. I looked for/found the key a lot.
  c. Mary wanted/owned the book very much.
  d. The customer touched/bought the vase a bit.
  e. John modified/recalled the password radically.
  f. How much did you study/prove the theorem?
  g. Mary loved/married Bill up to a point.
  h. Fred used/finished the book somewhat.
  i. I expected/got this present less than Alice did. 
  j. The box protects/contains the necklace considerably.
* The same diagnostic also picks out
  the class of unbounded quantitative indeterminate NPs
  that get NP-related partitive case in Finnish:
(7) a. Unb: A lot of bears, a lot of coffee.
    b. B:   #A lot of bear, #a lot of the bear, #a lot of a bear, #a lot of 2 bs
* The NP contrast at stake does not correspond exactly to definiteness
  or to any other familiar determiner feature.
  * Formally indefinite bare plural or mass nouns do not always get partitive
    with verbs like “get” or “seek”. They do so
    * only if they have a quantitatively indeterminate denotation. The examples
    * (8) illustrate how even indefinite bare plurals and mass nouns get
      accusative case if they denote a conventionally delimited set (of known or
      unknown cardinality).
(8) a Anu-Adess be-3Sg brilliant-PlAcc student-PlAcc
       ‘Anu has brilliant students’
    b Anu-Adess be-3Sg brilliant-PlPart student-PlPart
       ‘Anu has (some) brilliant students’
    c Aki-Adess have-3Sg big-PlAcc eyes-PlAcc / mustache-PlAcc
       ‘Aki has big eyes / a mustache’
    d Aki-Adess have-3Sg big-PlPart eyes-PlPart / mustache-PlPart
       ‘Aki has big eyes / mustaches in his possession’
    e Baby-Adess have-3Sg long-PlAcc hair-PlAcc
       ‘The/a baby’s hair is long’
    f Baby-Adess have-3Sg long-PlPart hair-PlPart
       ‘The/a baby has (some) long strands of hair’ (on its head, in its hand)
* a vs b: all of Anu’s students are brilliant, and implicates that everyone in
  some relevant comparison set has students. (8b) is indeterminate in both these
  c vs d: inalienable possession: the eyes must be Aki’s own two eyes and the
  e vs f: refers only to the totality of the baby’s own hair, (8f) could be
  about part of the baby’s own hair, or about an indeterminate number of loose
  strands it has in its possession.
* Conversely, a singular or definite NP gets the NP-related partitive if it is
  generic.  
  * In (9), ‘this rose’ is partitive <~ it means “roses of this particular kind”
(9) Puutarhuri istutt-i gardener kaikkialle tätä ruusu-a.
    plant-Past3Sg everywhere this-Part rose-Part
    ‘The gardener planted this rose everywhere.’
* Summarizing, we can say that an object is partitive either if it is
  * governed by one of a class of unbounded verbal predicates (aspect cond), or
  * quantitatively indeterminate (the NP-related condition). There has been
  * whether it is possible to unify these conditions.

    * unboundedness is the common denominator (Heinämäki 1984, Leino 1991)
* two weaknesses of unified
  * lack of a precise definition of the central concept of (un)boundedness,
  * there are languages in which the partitive (or another oblique case) has
    either just the aspectual function or just the NP-related function.
  * In this paper I attempt to overcome both these obstacles, by providing
    * a definition of (un)boundedness that covers the full range of
      accusative/partitive contrasts in Finnish, and by showing how
    * the difference in the role this feature plays in Finnish vs other langs
      can be systematically characterized
* the partitive vs. accusative case contrast in Finnish shares some of its
  functions with the aspect contrast in Russian and some of the other Slavic
  * It has been known for a long time that

  * emphasized notably by Dahl and Karlsson (1976) and by Dahl (1985). They
  * if either
    the verb is atelic (does not denote a completed event), or
    the object is an indefinite bare plural,
    then
    Russian in general requires imperfective aspect, and
    Finnish requires partitive case (see (10a)). Thus, in (10a) perfective

    * several other senses of temporal delimitation or incompleteness: 
      (was -ing as John entered) (for a while) (partly) (again and again)
* What ties these aspectual functions of partitive case and imperfective aspect

# 3 De Hoop: partitive as weak structural case 8

* de Hoop (1992) proposed to resolve the puzzle of the status of the partitive
  * typology of structural case. In addition to
  * STRONG eg accusative case, which she
  * WEAK structural case, of which the Finnish partitive is an instantiation.
  * both? default cases, configurationally licensed at D-structure
* WEAK
  not configurationally licensed by all transitive verbs but
  licensed only by a subclass of them.
  * Syntactically, weak structural case's special syntactic property is that it
    can only be licensed in their basic D-structure position
    =>, NPs bearing weak structural case do not undergo scrambling
    (which de Hoop assumes to be A-movement)
  * Semantically, weak structural case
    induces an existential reading on the NP that bears it. According to de
    * these  NPs are predicate modifiers, which combine semantically with the
      verbal predicate,
      restricting its denotation in the manner of adverbial modifiers.
* NPs that bear strong case, on the other hand, are arguments, interpreted as
  generalized quantifiers.
* de Hoop connects the syntactic and semantic properties of partitive case in a
  hE, On the
  * semantic side: no intrinsic connection between verb classes and NP propertys
    * the relation between case and aspect unexplained.
  * syntactic side, it glosses over the fundamental differences between the
    Finnish partitive case and the
    * other putative instances of “weak” case, such as the
    * Turkish bare accusative, or the Inuit absolutive. These
    * have to do with specificity — not quantitative indeterminacy — and
    * the same distribution in singular and plural NPs. Also,
    * while (according to de Hoop) weak case blocks scrambling,
      in Finnish partitive objects can scramble exactly like accusative objects.
(12) Matti shoot-3Sg [(the) bears] [often] [in Lapland] [with the/a shotgun])
  * can be in any of the 4! possible mutual orders,
    regardless of definiteness and telicity 
* Even the basic distribution of the partitive seems to be a problem for de Ho
  * partitive is assigned by
    * any transitive verb to quantitatively indeterminate objects (NP-rel prt)
    * a proper subclass of transitive verbs to any object (the aspectual partit)
  * De Hoop proposes to account for
    * NP-rel prt by her principle (p.  90 ff.) that
      objects bearing strong and weak case have strong and weak readings resp
      (i.e.  referential vs.  existential readings)

      predicate rather than as an independent argument” (p. 98), and that
      objects of atelic verbs are really predicate modifiers, licensed by weak
      case at D-structure (p. 111)
      * Short of an account of how predicate modifiers, or NPs with weak case,
        come by their two interpretations (NP-related and aspectual), this is
        hardly more than a restatement of the generalization to be explained.

# 4 Krifka: a unified semantics for partitive case 11

* Krifka 1992
  * not address the syntactic aspects of the problem,
  * an explicit semantic analysis which
    unifies the meanings of partitive case and imperfective aspect (his progres)
    or at least the meanings of some important uses of them.
  * partitive case and imperfective aspect are predicate modifiers that mean
    “part of”:
(17) 1. PART = λP λx' ∃x[P (x) ∧ x' ⊑ x]
     2. PROG = λP λe' ∃e[P (e) ∧ e' ⊑ e]
* Krifka shows that, at the VP level, partitive object marking is equivalent to
  imperfective V marking provided that certain additional conditions hold.
  * cond 1, V must denote a predicate with DIVISIVE REFERENCE : 12
    * ∀x∀y[P (x) ∧ y ⊑ x → P (y)]
    * That is, P is closed under the subpart relation. For example, _write(e)_
  * cond 2: the thematic relation R between
    an object in the denotation of the nominal predicate and
    an event in the denotation of V must have the properties in (19)
    * verbs of creation (eg write) and verbs of consumption and destru (eg eat)
(19)
  a. Uniqueness of objects : ∀e, x, x' [R(e, x) ∧ R(e, x' ) → x = x' ]
  b. Uniqueness of events : ∀e, e', x[R(e, x) ∧ R(e', x) → e = e' ]
  c. Mapping to objects : ∀e, e', x [R(e, x) ∧ e' ⊑ e → ∃x' [x' ⊑ x ∧ R(e, x )]]
  d. Mapping to events : ∀e, x, x' [R(e, x) ∧ x' ⊑ x → ∃e' [e' ⊑ e ∧ R(e, x )]]
* In order to get the partitive to yield the progressive reading, Krifka 1992
  supplements the two mapping properties [19c,d] with an additional assumption
  (20) If an event bears R to an object, then the whole object is eventually
       subjected to the event.
  * problematic since “John was writing a letter” not implies that John finished
* eg a verb that has the properties in (19) is write, in the “authorial” sense.
  * Let us furthermore assume that it also satisfies the property [20] (setting
    aside the abovementioned objection)
* Krifka’s theorem it then follows that
  an event of writing part of an object is part of an event of writing the obj,
  and conversely
  R(e',x'), R(e, x) => (e' ⊑ e <=> x' ⊑ x)
* The equivalence in (10) is thus a consequence of Krifka’s theory, at least for
* does not generalize to other classes of verbs (such as (1), (4), (21)), which
  * eg prove and buy do not have divisive reference: part of a proving or buying
  * Kiss, touch, and shoot at lack the uniqueness of objects property:
    kissing Mary and kissing Mary’s lips can be the same event.
  * And all these verbs (as well as such verbs as want, love, read, and write in
    many of its senses) do not have the uniqueness of events property:
    you can do these things twice to the same object. Nevertheless, the
* hE, equivalence between partitive and imperfective is valid for such verbs as
  * for “write”, not just in the authorial sense, but in all senses, as Russian
  * partitive case in Finnish
    * can be used for objects of numerous verbs, such as “buy”, “eat”, “read”,
    * must be used for others, such as “kiss”, which fail to meet one or more of
      * egy óra alatt megvette
      the requisite conditions in [18]-[19], as the examples in (21) attest:
(21) a Matti-SgNom buy-Pst3Sg milk-SgPart (hour-Acc)
      ‘Matti bought milk (for an hour)’
    b Matti-SgNom buy-Pst3Sg milk-SgAcc (hour-Iness)
      ‘Matti bought the milk (in an hour)’
    c Matti-SgNom read-Pst3Sg book-Pl-Part (hour-Acc)
      ‘Matti read books (for an hour)’
    d Matti-SgNom read-Pst3Sg book-Pl-Part (hour-Iness)
      ‘Matti read the books (in an hour)’
    e Anu kiss-Pst3Sg Esa-Part / #Esa-Acc (hour-Acc / hour-Iness)
      ‘Anu kissed Esa (for an hour / #in an hour)’
* Krifka (1992, 48) suggests that partitives like those in [21] are analogical
  extensions of the cases in (10). This could mean several different things,
  * What Krifka probably meant is that they are
    idiosyncratic usages which have arisen historically by analogy to the
  * Another view, more consonant with the idea that
    analogy is structural optimization, including in particular
    the projection of a grammatical regularity to new cases, would be that
    the innovations are systematic usages within a new grammar of Finnish that
    has arisen by a generalization in the rules of case assignment.  
    * the cases in [21] and the cases in (10) are equally regular usages, which
    * => Krifka’s analysis is not correct for the current state of the language
      (although it might have been for an earlier stage)
    * I believe the Finnish system is an “analogical” innovation only in this
      * I will present some evidence in favor of that position in section 8.
* Krifka’s analysis represents an idealization which
  misses some systematic aspects of Finnish partitive case assignment.
  * illuminating, and comes close to characterizing the partitive usage of
    another Finno-Ugric language, which represents an ancestral stage in the

# 5 Boundedness 14

* both the nominal category of partitive and the verbal category of aspect can
  as licensed by the unboundedness of the VP predicate
* This idea is not new.  In the Finnish tradition,
  * Leino 1991: boundedness is a property of situations and not just of
    individual predicates in isolation.
  * Verkuyl 1972: properties of the direct object influence the aspect of the pr
    * not a matter of the lexical category itself
    * aspect is constructed by the combination of the verb and its object (the
      VP) and subsequently of the VP and its subject
    * Verkuyl’s (1989) categories “terminative” and “durative” are
      very similar to “bounded” and “unbounded” used here.

# 6 Coercion 21

# 7 Partitive subjects 28

# 8 The evolution of the aspectual partitive 32

# 9 Conclusion 35

* The common factor of the aspectual and NP-related functions of partitive case
  and imperfective aspect is marking a VP’s unboundedness
* A VP has this property in virtue of having
  either an unbounded head or an unbounded argument
* Historical-comparative evidence suggests that the partitive’s emergence as
  a structural case is a precondition for the rise of its aspectual function.
