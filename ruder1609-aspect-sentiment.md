# Abstract

* Sentences in reviews form part of a reviewâ€™s argumentative structure.
  * build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the review structure and
    sentential context should thus inform the classification of each sentence.
* We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis
  * modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review with a hierarchical
    bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model 
* exper
  * outperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results 
  * competitive with the SOTA, and 
  * out-performs the SOTA on five multilin-gual, multi-domain datasets without
    any hand-engineered features or external resources
