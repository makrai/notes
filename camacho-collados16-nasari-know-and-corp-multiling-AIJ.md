# Abstract

* a novel multilingual vector representation, called Nasari
  * both concepts and named entities
  * words, senses and concepts [in a single] space
  * evaluation in 4 tasks, namely,
    * word similarity, sense clustering, domain labeling, and
      Word Sense Disambiguation
    * for each of which we report state-of-the-art performance 
      on several standard datasets across different languages

# Intro

* representations of word senses can be directly useful to
  * Word Sense Disambiguation (Navigli 2009)
  * semantic similarity [13, 129, 106]
  * coarsening sense inventories [92, 124]
  * alignment of lexical resources [101, 98, 108]
  * lexical substitution [75] and 
  * semantic priming [100]
* In our recent work Nasari [16], we proposed a method that exploits the 
  * structural knowledge derived from semantic networks, together with 
  * distributional statistics from text corpora
* In this article, we [extend Nasari to] 
  * a wider range of tasks
    * Semantic Similarity (Section 6)
    * Sense Clustering (Section 7)
    * Domain Labeling (Section 8) and 
    * Word Sense Disambiguation (Section 9)
  * summary of the experiments in Section 5

# 3. Representing texts as vectors

* lexical specificity and ... its fast computation (Section 3.1)
* our three types of vector, i.e.,
  lexical (Section 3.2), embedded (Section 3.3) and unified (Section 3.4)

## 3.5. Vector comparison
