# Abstract

* “Fake news detection” is defined as the task of categorizing news along a
  continuum of veracity, with an associated measure of certainty
* two major categories –
  * linguistic cue approaches (with machine learning), and
  * network-based behavioral data
    * message metadata or structured knowledge network queries
  * hybrid approach

# Introduction

* information is of questionable veracity
  (Ciampaglia, Shiralkar, Rocha, Bollen, Menczer & Flammini, 2015)

# LINGUISTIC APPROACHES

* Most liars use their language strategically to avoid being caught
  * language “leakage”
  * frequencies and patterns of pronoun, conjunction, and negative emotion word
    (Feng & Hirst, 2013)

## Data Representation

* tagging of words into respective lexical cues for example,
  * parts of speech or “shallow syntax” (Hancock & Markowitz, 2013),
  * affective dimensions (Vrij, 2006), or
  * location-based words (Hancock, et al, 2013)
  * [but no] resolution of ambiguous word sense (Larcker & Zakolyukina 2012).
  * useful in tandem with different, complementary analysis (Zhang, Fan, Zeng &
    Liu, 2012; Lary, Nikitov & Stone, 2010; Ott, Cardi, & Hancock, 2013)
    several of which are discussed in the remainder of this proposal
  * combine [syntax analysis] with other linguistic or network ...  techniques
    (Feng et al., 2012; Feng & Hirst, 2013)

## Semantic Analysis

* compatibility between a personal experience [and]
  a content “profile” derived from a collection of analogous data.
  (Feng & Hirst, 2013)
  * compatibility scores
    * Compatibility with the existence of some distinct aspect
      (eg. an art museum near the hotel)

## Rhetorical Structure and Discourse Analysis

* Systematic differences between deceptive and truthful messages in terms of
  their coherence and structure (Rubin & Lukoianova, 2014)
