Word representations: A simple and general method for semi-supervised learning
2010

#Abstract

* unsupervised word representations
  as extra word features [to an existing supervised NLP system]
* We evaluate
  * Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and
    HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words
  * on [near state-of-the-art supervised baselines of] NER and chunking.
  * each of the three word representations improves the accuracy
  * further improvements by combining different word representations
