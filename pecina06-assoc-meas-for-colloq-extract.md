Combining Association Measures for Collocation Extraction
2006

# 1 Introduction

* Lexical association measures
  * automatic collocation extraction (Manning and Schütze, 1999),
  * bilingual word alignment (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003) or
  * dependency parsing.
* An overview of the most widely used [association measures]
  * Manning and Schütze (1999) or
  * Pearce (2002).
* compare existing methods and suggest different evaluation schemes, e.g
  * Kita (1994) and Evert (2001).
* A comprehensive study of statistical aspects of word cooccurrences
  * Evert (2004) or Krenn (2000).
* In this paper: combining
* Czech data; two-word (bigram) collocations

# 2 Reference data

* reference set of collocations manually extracted
* dependency bigrams

# 3 Association measures

* estimation of joint and conditional bigram probabilities (Table 1, 1–3),
* mutual information and derived measures (4–9),
* statistical tests of independence (10–14),
* likelihood measures (15– 16), and various 
  other heuristic association measures and coefficients (17–55)
* information theory background (61–74)
* from information retrieval (75–82)
