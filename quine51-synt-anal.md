Willard Van Orman Quine
Two Dogmas of Empiricism
1951, 1953, 1961

#0

1. a belief in some fundamental cleavage between truths which are
  * analytic, or grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact and
  * synthetic, or grounded in fact
2. reductionism: the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to
   some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience
* effects of abandoning them is
  * blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and
    natural science
  * shift toward pragmatism

#1. BACKGROUND FOR ANALYTICITY

* Leibniz spoke of the truths of reason as true in all possible worlds
* Kant [interpreted by Quine]: a statement is analytic when it is true by
  virtue of _meanings_ and independently of fact
* [proper] names
  * Frege's example of 'Evening Star' and 'Evening Star'
  * Russell's of 'Scott' and 'the author of Waverly'
  * Quine: '9' and 'the number of the planets'
* general terms 'creature with a heart' and 'creature with a kidney,' e.g., are
  perhaps alike in extension but unlike in meaning
* Aristotle
  * it was essential in men to be rational, accidental to be two-legged
  * Things had essences, for Aristotle, but only linguistic forms have
    meanings
* it is not clear when linguistic forms should be regarded as synonymous
* (1) *No* *un*married man is married
* (2) No bachelor is married
* Carnap
  * A state-description is any exhaustive assignment of truth values to the
    atomic, or noncompound, statements
  * statement is then explained as analytic when it comes out true under every
    state-description
  * aimed primarily ... at ... the clarification of probability and induction

#II. DEFINITION p4

* analytic statements [which depends on the notion of synonymy] reduce to ..
  logical truths, by definition; 'bachelor,' for example, is defined as
  'unmarried man.'
* what Carnap calls explication --
  * an activity to which philosophers are given
  * the purpose is
    * not merely to paraphrase the definiendum into an outright synonym, but
    * actually to improve upon the definiendum by refining or supplementing its
      meaning
  * favored contexts (nem Ã©rtem)
* an extreme sort of definition which does not hark back to prior synonymies at
  all; namely, the explicitly conventional introduction of novel notations
* In logical and mathematical systems
  * two languages, the one a part of the other
    * The inclusive language, though redundant in grammar and vocabulary, is
      economical in message lengths, while
    * the part, called primitive notation, is economical in grammar and
      vocabulary
    * Whole and part are correlated by rules of translation whereby
      * each idiom not in primitive notation is equated to some complex built
        up of primitive notation. These
* rules of translation are the so-called definitions
  * three ways lately noted. The
    * definiens may be a faithful paraphrase of the definiendum into the
      narrower notation, preserving a direct synonymy 5b as of antecedent usage
    * the definiens may, in the spirit of explication, improve upon the
      antecedent usage of the definiendum
    * definiendum may be a newly created notation, newly endowed with meaning
      here and now

#III. INTERCHANGEABILITY p5

* synonymy of two linguistic forms consists simply in their interchangeability
  in all contexts without change of truth value;
  * interchangeability, in Leibniz's phrase, salva veritate
  * synonyms so conceived need not even be free from vagueness, as long as the
    vaguenesses match
* we are notconcerned here with synonymy in the sense of complete identity in
  psychological associations or poetic quality; indeed no two expressions are
  synonymous in such a sense

#IV. SEMANTICAL RULES p9

* I do not know whether the statement 'Everything green is extended' is
  analytic

#V. THE VERIFICATION THEORY AND REDUCTIONISM p12

* verification theory of meaning, which has been
  * conspicuous in the literature from Peirce onward, is that
  * the meaning of a statement is the method of empirically confirming or
    infirming it
  * An analytic statement is that limiting case which is confirmed no matter
    what
* as long as it is taken to be significant in general to speak of the
  confirmation and infirmation of a statement, it seems significant to speak
  also of a limiting kind of statement which is vacuously confirmed, ipso
  facto, come what may; and such a statement is analytic

#VI. EMPIRICISM WITHOUT THE DOGMAS p15

* knowledge or beliefs ... is a man- made fabric which impinges on experience
  only along the edges
* it is misleading to speak of the empirical content of an individual statement
* the relative likelihood, in practice, of our choosing one statement rather
  than another for revision in the event of recalcitrant experience
  * Conservatism figures in such choices, and so does the quest for simplicity
* science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light
  of past experience
* Carnap has recognized that he is able to preserve a double standard for
  ontological questions and scientific hypotheses only by assuming an absolute
  distinction between the analytic and the synthetic;
