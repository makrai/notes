Conceptual Graphs for a Data Base Interface
1976

# Abstracr

* formalism, called conceptual graphs, that can
  * describe data according to the user’s view and
  * access data according to the system’s view. In addition
  * represent functional dependencies in the data base and
  * support inferences and computations
    that are not explicit in the initial query.
