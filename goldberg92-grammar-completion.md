# 1 Intro

* BUG differs from other unification-based grammar-writing tools in two major
  * feature geometries.  The feature geometry is a (recursive) definition of
    well-formed feature structures, which must be specified in the
    source grammar.The other major difference is that BUG uses 
  * a built-in performance restriction, called the string completion limit (SCL)
    * limit the generative power of a context-free grammar to regular languages.
  * separation of the structural description (SD, conditions of application)
    from the structural change (SC, effect of application) in source rules.

# 2 Feature Geometries

* Tile term feature geometry is taken from generative phonology, where it was
  introduced by Clements (1985). A feature geometry determines what feature
  structures are allowed by 
  * specifying what (complex or atomic) values each path can have. In this way,
  * feature cooccurrence restrictions (FCRs, Gazdar+ 1985), namely, those
    * local in the sense that they can be formulated in terms of path
      continuation restrictions
    * arbitrary or global constraints on wen-fornmd feature structures leads
      to undecidable systems if coupled with structure sharing 
      (Blackburn and Spaan, 1991)
  * specify whether or not the continuations of a given path are pairwise compat
    * e.g.  the attributes FINITE and NON-FINITE can be made incompatible
      continuations of the attribute VERB_FORM. As a result, in any actual
      feature structure at most one edge can lead from a node that a path ending
      in VERB_FORM leads to. What this mechanism allows us to express are
      also local FCRs, e.g.~ ~([VERB..FORM FINITE] A [VERB-FORM NON-FINITE])

## 2.2 How Are Used?  Feature Geometries 3. The main advantage of using

* makes the unification operation and the unifiabi[ity test more efficient.
  * geometry-based unification will fail if incompatible continuations of a path
    are to be unified
  * extra check is performed each time new continuations are created during
    unification, lfowever, if the feature geometry is reasonably structured
    (i.e., not flat), then the cost of this extra checking is insignificantly 
  * major distinctions between linguistic objects are made by attributes closer
    to the root of a feature structure, and minor features are in deeply
    * the information that something is a verb will be superordinate to the
      information that it has a second person form.  As a consequence, the most
* assists the grammar-writer to develop her/his grammar in two ways. First,
  * the feature geometry forces her/him to take the semantics of features and
    feature structures more seriously than is typically the case. Second, since
  * feature geometries also determine which paths can share values. The 
    * checking of structure sharing at compile-time providing additional error
      checking on the grammar. These two by-products of using feature geometries

# 3 The string completion limit

## 3.1

* constraints on the complexity of derivation trees has a long tradition in
  * Yngve (1961) limits the depth of possible derivation trees, or 
  * limitations on the direction of their branching (e.g., Yngve, 1960) are
  * either too weak or too strong on their own. However, there is a suggestion
* Kornai's (1984) hypothesis, in terms of which 
  * broad enough in its coverage, and yet conceptually simple. This is
  * any string that can he the beginning of a grammatical string can be
    completed with k or less terminal symbols, where k (i.e., the SCL) is a
    small integer. For example, consider: 
    (1) This is1 the2 dog3 that4 chaseds the s eat7 thats ate9 theto r a
    (2) The 1 cheese2 thats the4 rats that6 the7
* imposes a limit on the depth of center-embedding; but, as can be seen from
  * not constrain the depth of right-branching structures. 
  * Left branching, however, is limited, though the effect of this limitation is
    less pronounced than in the case of center-embedding.  The example with the
  * K in English can be accommodated if k is 3: In those cases when the above
    * (3) Aflerl as very
    ... long walk, sleep!
  * cross-serial dependencies
    * Although the current implementation of BUG uses the context-free source
      grammar format, in which so-called cross-serial dependencies cannot be
    * SCL also puts an upper bound on tile length of these:
* additional consequences (and maybe more). First, it 
  * excludes certain lexical categories, such as modifiers of adjective
    modifiers (if k < 4). If, say, shlumma were a word of that category, then we
    would need at least 4 words to complete Aftera shlumma... (cf.  (3) above).
  * all upper limit is placed on the number of obligatory daughters of
    non-terminal nodes.

## 3,2.  How Is the SCL Used?  

* we can produce the biggest regular subset of a context-free language that
  respects the SCL can be sketched as follows. First we 
  * produce a recursive transition network (RTN ) A equivalent to the grammar
  * An RTN is like a finite-state automaton, but its input symbols may be RTNs
    or terminal symbols.) Then we 
  * assign a minimum completion length ( K in the tables above) to each node
  * If B is an RTN accepted by the transition from state s1 to state s2 in A,
  * Since the K-value of s2 may be bigger than 0, assigning K values to some
    states of B may be impossible (if those values would exceed k). We leave
    out those states (and whatever additional states and transitions depend on
    them).  
  * In those cases when the above procedure would not terminate (i.e., when s2
    is an accepting state in A and B is the same RTN as some other RTN C the
    acceptance of which takes the machine to s2), we eliminate the transition
    corresponding to B, and collapse s1 with the initial state of C (with the
    standard technique). So the procedure will terminate in all cases

# 4 structural description vs structural change

* unificationalists have been asserting that this old-fashioned distinction
  should be abandoned 
  (ie. pieces of information coming from different sources have the same
  status), many voices have been raised to show that the 
* origins of a piece of information may matter (see Zaenen and Karttunen, 1984;
  Pullum and Zwicky, 1986; Ingria. 1990).  
* in BUG
  * The structural description in a BUG rule specifies the conditions under
    which the rule cml be applied in the parsing process. T h a t is, when
    parsing, it refers to the right-hand side of the rewrite rule only, and it
    is never used to update any feature structure.  
    * check unifiability, 
  * The structural change describes what action to take when the structural
    description is satisfied, i.e., how to build a new feature structure (when
    parsing, this corresponds to the left-hand side of tile context-free rule).
    * builds structure.  In usual unification-based grammars, the conditions
    * Unifiability differs from unification in a crucial respect, which is
    * example: 
      1.
      A: [] 
      B: [NUMBER = SINGULAR] 
      C: [NUMBER = PLURAL] 
      A is unifiable with B and A is unifiable with C, even though B is not
      unifiable with C. Therefore, if a structural description requires
      unifiability of A with both B and C, it will be satisfied. However, if we
      were to formulate tiffs requirement in terms of unification, as is
      currently done in unification-based grammars, then A, B and C will not
      satisfy this requirement. A similar example from 'real life' is the
      2. auxiliary verb should agree with each subject of a co-ordination: (5)
        (6) Will Jean leave and the others arrive?  This sentence is in because
        will's NUMBER is unifiable with both that of Jean and that of the
        others, although the unification of all three NUMBEII. values still
        leads to failure. So BUG will behave correctly in this case.

# 5 Generative Capacity

* distinction between the context-free grammar format and context-free grammars.
  * a unification-based grammar in the context-free format is not context-free
    unless the number of possible feature structures arising in all its possible
    derivations is finite. By the same token, the 
  * automata compiled by BUG would not recognize a regular language if we did
    not constrain the possible feature structures that they give rise to. 
* The separation of SDs from SCS allows ~IUG to avoid this problem. Since 
  * SDs are only used in unifiability tests and are never modified at run-time,
    they can be constrained in such a way that they yield a finite set of
    equivalence classes of feature structures. Moreover, carrying out 
  * SCs only affects the structures being built and cannot interfere with the
    trajectory through the automaton. Incidentally, this means that
    unification (but not unifiability tests!) may never fail. For that
* we use an associative, idempotent and commutative version of 'default
  unification' (see Bouma, 1990), which we are not going into here.  The
  automaton produced by BU~ is, thus, actually finite-state. We consider this an
  extremely important benefit, if not the most important one, of separating SDs
  from SCs in a grammar-writing system.
