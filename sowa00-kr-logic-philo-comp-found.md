#Preface xi

##Exercises

* The two basic notations used for logic are 
  * predicate calculus and 
  * conceptual graphs.
    * two-dimensional form of logic that is based on the semantic networks of
      AI and the logical graphs of C. S. Peirce

##Organization. 

* Chapter 1 introduces logic through a historical survey, ranging from
  Aristodes syllogisms to the modern graphic and algebraic systems.  The
  details of the predicate calculus and conceptual graph notations are
  summarized in Appendix A.
* Chapter 2, which is the most philosophical in the book, introduces ontology,
  the study of existence. 
  * Ontology defines the categories of things that are expressed in the
    predicates of predicate logic, the slots in frames, the tables of a
    database, or the classes of an object-oriented system.
* Chapter 3 introduces the principles of knowledge representation and their
  role in adapting logic and ontology to the task of constructing computable
  models
* Chapter 4 presents methods for representing dynamically changing processes
  and events. Petri nets and dataflow graphs
* Chapter 5 shows how purpose and context affect knowledge representation and
  the various theories of modal and intentional logic.
* Chapter 6, on "knowledge soup," stresses the limitations of logic. It
  discusses the vague, uncertain, unanalyzed, and often inconsistent mix of
  facts, opinions, and rules of thumb that people have in their heads.
* Chapter 7 discusses the problems of knowledge sharing and the ongoing efforts
  related to the ANSI and ISO projects on ontology and conceptual schemes. It
  illustrates critical issues in using logic-based techniques to facilitate
  communication and interoperabiUty of heterogeneous computer systems.
