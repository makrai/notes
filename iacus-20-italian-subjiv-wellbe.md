    the Integrated Sentiment Analysis (iSA) algorithm
* we
  * weighting procedure adopted to partially overcome the selection bias
    caused by the use of data from social network
  * SWBI ITA dimensions in the considered period at the regional level

  * methodological drawbacks (Deaton 2012; Feddersen+ 2016)
    * explicit questions can be influenced by contextual elements
    * non-response bias
    * expensive and almost impossible to obtain data with
      high-frequency and adequate territorial granularity
    * limited and undersized presence of the subjective and perceived dimension
      (Iacus+ 2017)
* our team, with the aim of finding complementary indicators to the traditional
  * data coming from Twitter
