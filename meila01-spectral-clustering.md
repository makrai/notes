* general approach [is to use a standard clustering method] on relevant
  eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix of A
* different ways to define a Laplacian
  * different mathematical interpretations
* eigenvectors of the Laplacian that are relevant
  * the [eigenvectors] that correspond to smallest several eigenvalues
    except for the smallest eigenvalue which will have a value of 0
