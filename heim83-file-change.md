File Change Semantics and the Familiarity Theory of Definiteness
Irene Heim
1983

# 1 Introduction

* the "familiarity theory of definiteness."
 = * What is the difference in meaning between definite/indef noun phrases
 = * the answer by Traditional grammarians Christophersen and Jespersen
 = * finds little favor with semanticists trained in twentieth century logic
 = * (1) A definite is used to refer to something that is already familiar at the
 =   current stage of the conversation
 = * An indefinite is used to introduce a new referent
 = * the logically minded semanticist will notice immediately that
 =   (1) presumes that definites and indefinites are referring expressions
 =   * very objectionable
 =   * only if there is a referent at all can is be familiar or new
* there are nonreferential uses of definite and indefinite NPs
 = * I will take it for granted without repeating the familiar arguments
 =   (2) Every cat ate its food
 =   (3) John didn't see a cat
 = * anal
 =   (2) has a reading where "its"
 =     * a personal pronoun, i.e. a type of definite NP,
 =     * functions as a so-called "bound variable pronoun" and
 =       doesn't refer to any particular cat
 =   (3) with negation taking widest scope, the indefinite "a cat" fails to refer
* I will try to revive and defend the familiarity theory, or a very similar one
 = * just different enough from (1) to avoid the presumption of referentiality
 = * accordingly deviates from standard assumptions in logical semantics
 =   * familiarity and novelty as a central pair of notions, and it takes
 =   * neither definites nor indefinites to be quantifiers
 = * enables us to make better predictions about their participation in anaphora
 = * I return to this point in section 7 below, but first I must lay out the theo

# 2 Karttunen's "Discourse Referents" 2

* Karttunen (1968a, b, 1976) introduces the notion of
 = "discourse reference", in place of "reference"
 = * So instead of principle (1), he has a requirement that
 =   a definite NP has to pick out an already familiar discourse referent, wherea
 =   an indefinite NP always introduces a new discourse referent
 = * an NP may have a discourse referent even when it has no referent
(4) John came, and so did Mary. **One of them** brought a cake
 = * "one of them" is indefinite, therefore (1) would seem to predict that it
 =   must refer to an as yet "unfamiliar" person
 = * both John and Mary, are familiar when "one of them" gets uttered and should
 =   consequently be excluded as potential referents for "one of them"
 = * in Karttunen's version in terms of discourse referents
 = * "one of them", since it is indefinite, its discourse referent must be new
 =   and must be distinct from the discourse referents of "John" and "Mary"
 = * NPs with distinct discourse reference sometimes happen to coincide in ref,
 = * (4) involves three discourse referents, but only two referents
(5) Everybody found a cat and kept it. It ran away`*`
 = * the first "it", but not the second, can be anaphoric to "a cat",
 =   (in the reading "everybody" > "a cat")
 = * the first "it" and its antecedent "a cat" both fail to refer,
 =   => the traditional version of the familiarity theory cannot be applied
 = * in terms of discourse referents, however, we can describe what is going on
 =   * The indefinite "a cat" introduces a discourse referent
 =   * The first "it" picks up that same discourse referent, which ~~ having just
 =     been introduced ~~ is familiar, as required
 =   * At the end of (5a), this discourse referent ceases to exist
 =   * no longer available when the second "it" comes along
 =   * the second "it" must find the familiar discourse referent elsewhere
* discourse referents behave in ways which make no sense to real referents
 = * there are discourse referents for NPs that have no referents
 = * may suddenly go out of existence
 = * if a discourse referent
 =   gets first introduced inside the scope of a quantifier (here: "everybody"),
 =   then its lifespan cannot extend beyond the scope of that quantifier
* what are discourse referents?
 = * Karttunen formulates a number of generalizations about discourse referents,
 =   i.e. about the conditions under which they get introduced and
 =   the factors that determine their lifespan
 = * these generalizations combine with Karttunen's version of the familiarity th
 = * no explicit definition
 = * some aspect of the meaning of a word or construction of English are the
 =   capacity for introducing, picking up, or influencing the lifespan of,
 =   discourse referents
 = * is that an entirely separate aspect of meaning, or is it
 =   dependent upon other aspects of meaning, such as the referential and
 =   truth-conditional aspect? ~~ I hope to shed light on Questions of this sort
* I suggesting that Karttunen's discourse referents = "file cards"
 = * elements of a so-called "file"
 = * file: a theoretical construct which mediates between language and the world

# 3 Conversation and File-keeping 4

* A listener's task of understanding what is being said in the course of a
 = conversation bears relevant similarities to a file clerk's task
 = * to understand an utterance is to keep a file
 = * the file, at every time in the course of the utterance, contains the
 =   information that has so far been conveyed by the utterance
 = * The file metaphor was first suggested
 =   to impose a file-like structure on the common ground (Stalnaker 1979)
 = * the file metaphor for more or less similar purposes eg Karttunen (1976)
 = * my files are closely related to the
 =   "discourse representation structures" of Kamp (1981)
(6) (a) A woman was bitten by a dog. (b) She hit it. (c) It jumped over a fence
 = * Before the utterance starts, the listener has an empty file,
 =   i.e. a collection of zero file cards. Call that empty file "F'"
 = * (6a) uttered => put two cards into the file, gives each card a number, 1 & 2
```
 = F 1 :
 = 1
 = − is a woman
 = − was bitten by 2
 = 2
 = − is a dog
 = − bit 1
```
 = * (6b) gets uttered, which prompts the listener to update the cards
 =   * 1 += "hit 2", 2 += "was hit by 1"
 = * (6c). The listener takes a new card, numbers it "3", writes on it "is a fen"
* How do definites differ from indefinites?
 = (7) For every indefinite, start a new card. Definite => update an old card
 = * reminiscent of principle (1) above
 = * incorporating a version of the familiarity theory of definiteness
 = * not referents are supposed to be old or new, but rather file cards
 = * it is quite conceivable for
 =   there to be a file card that fails to describe a referent, or for
 =   two different file cards to happen to describe the same thing, or for
 =   file cards to be introduced into and be removed from the file
* Now give a more precise account of the theoretically relevant properties of
 = files and of the role they play in the semantic interpretation
 = * assumptions;
 = * The grammar of a language generates sentences with representations on
 =   various levels of analysis, among them a level of "logical form"
 = * Each logical form is assigned a "file change potential",
 =   i.e.  a function from files into files
 =   * Given an utterance with a logical form, this function will determine
 =     how you get from the file that obtains prior to the utterance to
 =     the file that comes to obtain as a result of the utterance
 =   * The system moreover includes an assignment of truth conditions to files
 =   * logical forms themselves are not assigned truth conditions, only thr files
* I will elaborate on its various components in the next few sections

# 4 Files and the World 6

* the association of files with their truth conditions
* line up the sequence of cards in the file with a seq of actual individuals
* I also admit sequences whose domains are not initial segments of N
 = * E.g. a function that assigns an individual each to the numbers 2 and 7, but
 =   is not defined for any other numbers, also qualifies as a sequence
 = * This would be the sort of sequence to satisfy a file whose only two cards
 =   are numbered "2" and "7"
* the set of all sequences that satisfy a given file: "Sat(F)"
 = * "the satisfaction set of F"
(9) Sat(F) = def {a_N : a_N satisfies F}
 = * "a_N ", "b_M ", and the like range over sequences, where
 =   the subscripts "N", "M", etc. stand for each sequence's domain
* the card-numbers that are used in a given file: "Dom(F)", "the domain of F"
* In the remainder of this article, I will often
 = describe a file solely in terms of its domain and satisfaction set
 = * that does not suffice to pick out a unique file

# 5 Semantic Categories and Logical Forms

* the upper part of diagram (8) and some of the assumptions about logical forms
* logical forms are disambiguated in two respects: scope, and anaphoric rels
 = * unlike other syntactic levels of representation
 = * Scope is marked configurationally, with an element c-commanding its scope,
 = * anaphoric relatedness is marked by coindexing
 = * The relation between sentences and their logical forms is
 =   defined by a set of
 =   * transformational rules that derive logical forms from syntactic reprs and
 =   * wellformedness constraints on the output of those rules
 = * These assumptions about logical form are taken over from
 =   Chomsky's "Revised Extended Standard Theory" (May 1977) and Reinhart (1976)
* ~ rules discriminate between semantic categories, eg variables, operators, etc
 = * both that derive logical forms and
 =   that interpret them by assigning them file change potentials
 = * Here I will not go into such questions as
 =   how many and which semantic categories there are, and
 =   to what extent the syntactic category determines semantic category
 = * there are at least the following semantic categories and they include at
 =   least the kinds of things listed, whether as a matter of stipulation or of
 =   * variables: pronouns, empty NPs, indices on NPs with predicate heads
 =       (see below for illustration of the latter)
 =   * predicates: verbs, nouns;
 =   * operators: "every", negation
* rules and constraints that define the relation between the
 = syntactic representation of a sentence and its logical form
 = * I will be very informal and incomplete here
(12) = She hit it
 =     A cat arrived
 =     Every cat died
* general assumptions about logical forms:
 = * Every NP in logical form carries a numerical index
 = * Only variables occur in the argument positions of predicates
 = * NPs that are not variables, i.e. those headed by predicates,
 =   are adjoined to their scopes and coindexed with their argument position
 = * Operators are adjoined as sisters to their argument(s)
 =   * Most operators are 2-place operators, in particular the quantifiers;
 =   * some may be 1-place, e.g.  negation
* how these assumptions follow from the interaction between
 = rules of logical-form-construction,
 = wellformedness constraints on logical forms, and
 = limitations on semantic interpretability
* contrast between structures (12b) and (12c)
 = * due to an assumption on which determiners are operators
 = * the articles "a" and "the" are not, "every" is
* What then is the semantic category of articles? None at all
 = * They are treated as though they weren't there at all (when sem interpret)
* What I have so far said about semantic categorization
 = applies only to lexical items and other basic units, and
 = fails for the complex building blocks of logical forms, such as
 = S-constituents and predicate-headed NP-constituents
* complex constituents are propositions if any categ
 = * With some simplification
 = * all complex constituents that are of any semantic category at all are propos
 = * These subdivide into
 =   * atomic propositions, which consist of a predicate and its arguments, and
 =   * molecular propositions, which are made up of other propositions and
 =     may or may not involve an operator
* two kinds of atomic propositions
 = * dominated by S and made up of a verb and its subject & complements (if any),
 =   where the verb is the predicate and the variables in the subject and
 =   complement positions are its arguments
 =   * In (12), [_S she_1 hit it_2 ], [_S e_1 arrived], and [_S e_1 died]
 =     exemplify this kind of atomic proposition
 = * have a noun as the predicate, in which case the dominating node is NP
 =   * (12) contains the examples `[ NP_1 a cat]` and `[ NP_{1--} cat]`
 =   * always have one of their arguments realized as a mere numerical index
 =     which appears on the dominating NP-node. "Cat", for instance, is a 1-place
 =     predicate, and its argument in the examples just cited is the index 1
 =   * This is why I included "indices on NPs with predicate heads" in the above
 =     list of variables

# 6 Logical Forms and their File Change Potentials 9

* assignment of file change potentials to logical forms `p`
* notation, the symbol "+" stands for the file change operation
* F + p = F'
* I will characterize only how the satisfaction set is affected ie "Sat (F + p)"
* by means of a recursive definition
 = * the file changes induced by atomic propositions and then characterize
 = * the file changes that molecular propositions bring about
* The files can now be described as follows:
```
 = Dom(F 1) = Dom(F_2) = {1, 2}
 = Sat(F 1) = {<a 1, a_2 >: a 1 is a woman, a_2 is a dog, and a_2 bit a 1}
 = Sat(F_2) = {<a 1, a_2 >: a 1 is a woman, a_2 is a dog, a_2 bit a 1, and
 =                                                                   a 1 hit a_2}
```
* the transition from Sat (F 1) to Sat (F_2) consists in
 = eliminating from Sat (F 1) all those pairs which
 = fail to satisfy the sentence being processed,
 = i.e. those pairs which fail to stand in the relation that the predicate of the
 = sentence denotes, in this case the relation of hitting
 = `Sat(F_2) = {<a 1, a_2 >: <a 1, a_2 > \in Sat(F 1)
 =                                               and <a 1, a_2 > \in Ext("hit")}
 = * (I write "Ext" for "the extension of".)
 = The general rule (subject to later revision):
 = (13) Let F be a file, and let p be an atomic proposition that consists of
 = an n-place predicate R and an n-tuple of variables whose indices are i_1,..i_n
 = `Sat(F + p) = {a N : a N \in Sat(F) and <a_{i_1}, ..., a_{i_n}> \in Ext(R)}`
 = Applied to the file F 1 and the logical form (12a), (13) gives us:
 = Sat(F 1 + (12a)) = Sat(F_2), as intended
* the choice of indices in the logical form that grammar provides for the
 = sentence "She hit it": there are infinitely many
 = * We also have to say something to explain that despite the infinity of
 =   logical forms, real-life utterances can be immediately understood unambigly
 = * To appreciate the problem, put yourself into the imaginary file clerk's shos
* How to excluded
 = (a) _She 1 hit it 1_ is easy to exclude: there is
 = * a well-known constraint, called "Disjoint Reference"
 =   * a wellformedness condition on some level of representation in the grammar
 = (b) She 3 hit it 7 :
 =   * the file clerk must take into account what his current file looks like
 =   * a principle that constrains the choice of logical form relative to a file.
 =   * The principle, which I call the "Novelty/Familiarity Condition", is this:
 =     (15) Let F be a file, p an atomic proposition. Then
 =     p is appropriate with respect to F only if,
 =     for every noun phrase NP_i with index i that p contains:
 =     if NP i is definite, then i \in Dom(F), and
 =     if NP i is indefinite, then i \notin Dom(F)
 =   * (14b) contains two definite NPs, "she 3 " and "it 7 ", whose indices fail
 =   * we must generally assume that NPs in logical form are marked for defness
* other conditions on when a logical form is appropriate w.r.t. a file
 = * Much of what has been discussed under the name of "presupposition"
* the Novelty/Familiarity Condition (15) will still let through some unwanted
 = eg (c) She 2 hit it 1 :
 = * we need some account of gender, which I will not provide here
 = * different kinds of definites, e.g. personal pronouns differ from
 =   definite descriptions
 =   * Another problem whose solution I must leave for another occasion
* molecular
 = * an example with an indefinite, such as the sentence "A cat arrived"
 = * logical forms is (12b), from above, this time with the definiteness filled
 = * To determine the file change that (12b) induces, we will have to consider
 =   two questions:
 =   1. since (12b) is a molecular proposition, we have to ask ourselves
 =     how its overall effect on the file may be calculated on the basis of the
 =     file changes that each of its two parts would induce
 =   2. which rules of file change pertain to each of those parts?
1. We compute the file change of (12b) as a whole by subjecting the file
 = first to the change that the left constituent dictates, and
 = subsequently to the file change that the right constituent dictates
 = * successive left-to-right mode of file change is this:
(18) Let F be a file, and let p be an atomic proposition that consists of
 = an n-place predicate R and an n-tuple of variables whose indices are
 = i1..i_n respectively. Then:
`Sat(F + p) = {a N \cup b M \in A N \cup M : a N \in Sat(F),
 =                 M = {i 1, ..., i n}, and <b i 1, ..., b i n > \in Ext(R)}`
 = * \cup in unification of sequences
 =   * the union of two sequences is itself a sequence just in case they coincide
 =     on their common domain
 = * allows for cases where F + p has a larger domain than F
 = * informally, (18) says that every sequence in Sat(F + p) has to include as
 =   sub-sequences a sequence `a_N` satisfying F and a sequence b M satisfying the
 =   proposition pl
 =   * Whenever you can find an a N satisfying F and a b M satisfying p, where
 =     a N and b M agree on the intersection of their domains, link them together
 =     and the result, a N \cup b M, will be a member of Sat(F + p)
 = * That a N and b M have to agree on the common part of their domains is
 =   expressed in (18) by requiring "a N \cup b M \in A N \cup M"
 = * A^{N\cupM} denotes the set of functions from N \cup M into A, and
* Returning to our example, assume for concreteness that we start out with the
(21) p is
 = true w.r.t. F if F + p is true,
 = false w.r.t. F if F + p is false, and
 = truth-value-less w.r.t. F if F + p is undefined
 = * makes reference to the notion of truth that I defined for files in (11)
 = * equates the truth conditions of what is being said with those of the
 =   resulting file
 = * limited to cases where we can assume the truth of the file we start out

# 7 The Non-quantificational Analysis of Indefinites 14

* I am only half way through with my recursive set of rules for assigning fil ch
* take a break and have a critical look at the present analysis of indef NPs
 = * compares with the widely accepted Russellian analysis
 = * "quantificational analysis of indefinites", as I will call it
 = * Russell (1919); the indefinite article is treated as an existential quantif
 =   and sentences of the form (22) are assigned logical analyses of roughly the
 =   form (23)
 = "A cat arrived", for instance, would be logically analyzed as:
 = "\exists x (cat(x) & x arrived)"
 = * accepted by the vast majority of philosophers and linguists
* This paper contains what I will call a "non-quantific analysis of indefs"
 = * an indefinite is just a proposition with a variable free in it
 = * eg "a cat" corresponds to something like "cat(x)"
 = * the logical analysis of that sentence is again a proposition with a free var
 =   Y(x) & (X x Z)
* This section is intended to bring to bear some linguistic evidence
* But first let me clarify to what extent the two analyses agree in their predic
* my theory predicts existential truth-conditions for such sentences
 = * By the truth criterion (21) for logical forms, we know that (12b) is true
 =   * Dom(F) must not contain 1, for F  (12b) to be defined
 =   * Sat(F (12b)) must be non-empty
 =   Rules (16) and (18) determine that Sat(F + (12b)) = {a N \cup b {1} \in
 =   A^N\cup{1} : a N \in Sat(F), b 1 is a cat, and b 1 arrived}
 = * just in case there is at least one cat that arrived
 = * the proof did not depend on any particular properties of F other than that
 =   it be true and that (12b) be appropriate w.r.t. it
 = * because the truth of a file has existential quantification built into it:
 =   * defined as there being at least one satisfying sequence
 = * So my disagreement with the quantificational analysis of indefinites is
 =   * not a disagreement about whether or not we understand statements with
 =     indefinites in them as existentially quantified
 =   * what is to be held responsible for the existential force
 = * find any empirical evidence that will discriminate between these two views,
 =   * We will have to resort to relatively indirect evidence like the following
* certain undebatable cases of quantifying NPs are subject to tighter
 = restrictions on anaphora than certain other NPs
(25) Every soldier is armed. He will shoot
(26) He is armed. He will shoot
* 26: The two "he"'s can be anaphorically related in (26), but
* 25: no anaphoric relation is possible between "every soldier" and "he" in
 = * Why should this be so? ± An explanation suggests itself if we
 = * assume that "every" is a quantifier, pronouns are variables, and
 =   (25) and (26) have logical analyses of essentially these forms:
(25') \forall x i (soldier (x i) ~> armed (x i)) & (x j will shoot)
(26') armed (x i) & (x j will shoot)
* Is i = j or i != j?
  * Let us try that both texts permit readings with i = j as well as with i != j
  * 26' substantially different satisfaction condition i=j vs i != j
  * 25' same satisfaction condition applies regardless of whether x i and x j
    are different variables or the same
    * This seems to be what is behind our judgment that (25) has no reading
      where "every soldier" and "he" are "anaphorically related"
    * Even if we make a point of coindexing: a semantically "vacuous" coindexing

What we have just observed about (25') falls under a general law, so to speak a design
feature of quantificational logic:
(27) If x i is bound by a quantifier whose scope does not include x j, then coindexing
between x i and x j can only be vacuous
(27) makes explicit what it is about the logical analysis of (25) that makes it different
from the logical analysis of (26) in such a way that (25) will permit only vacuous
coindexing where (26) permits the sort of non-vacuous coindexing that we perceive as
an anaphoric reading. The crucial point is that "every soldier" was analyzed as aFile Change Semantics
239
quantifying NP, whereas there was no quantifier assumed to occur in the correspond-
ing position in (26)

What does all this have to do with the choice between a quantificational and a non-
quantificational analysis of indefinites? Well, since (27) makes reference to quantifiers,
we might try to exploit it as a diagnostic test for quantifyingness: If indefinites turn out
to bear non-vacuous coindexing relations to variables outside their scope, then that
ought to show they are not quantifiers. Unfortunately, this test is not as foolproof in
application as one might hope. But let's try it first

Consider (28)
(28) A soldier will accompany us. He will shoot

Presumably, (28) would be analyzed as (28') under a quantificational treatment of
indefinites, but as (28'0) under a non-quantificational treatment
(28') 9x i (soldier (x i) & (x i will accompany us)) & (x j will shoot)
(28'0) (soldier (x i) & (x i will accompany us)) & (x j will shoot)

By (27), the coindexing i = j in (28') is bound to be vacuous, while (28'0) contains no
obstacle to non-vacuous coindexing. Our intuitive judgment is that anaphora is possible
in (28), just like in (26), and unlike in (25). We can straightforwardly predict the
anaphoric reading by assuming a logical form along the lines of (28'0), with i = j, a non-
vacuous coindexing. (28'), on the other hand, would seem to preclude an anaphoric
reading. This is prima facie evidence in favor of the non-quantificational analysis of
indefinites

There are various ways in which the conclusion just drawn can be, and has
been, challenged. First, one might call into question a tacit assumption I have been
making about the scope-options for quantifying NPs. With both (25) and (28), I took
it for granted that a quantifying NP that occurred in the first sentence of each
text could take scope at most over that sentence, not over the entire bisentential text

Had I permitted the quantifying NP "every soldier" in (25) and the putatively
quantifying NP "a soldier" in (28) to take wider scope than the sentence, then the
variable x j in (25') and (28') could have come under the scope of 8 or 9, in which case
i = j would have been a non-vacuous coindexing. (Cf. (27).) This suggests that the
quantificational analysis of indefinites could be saved if one were to maintain that
indefinites, unlike certain other quantifying NPs, can take scope across several sen-
tences. 13

A second way of undermining my use of (28) as evidence against a quantificational
analysis of indefinites goes like this: What we customarily describe as "anaphoric
relations" may not be one and the same kind of logical relation in all cases, and in
particular, need not always be non-vacuous identity of variables. So even if the logical
analysis of (28) is (28') (with either i = j or i != j, it doesn't matter), we may still use (28)
with the intention that x j refer to whatever individual is responsible for the truth of
"9x i (soldier(x i) & (x i will accompany us))". Viewed in this way, the so-called "ana-
phoric" use of the pronoun in (28) has really a lot more in common with deictic
pronoun uses than with bound-variable anaphora: The pronoun is here taken to refer to240

Irene Heim
a contextually salient individual, just like deictic pronouns do, except that in this case
the crucial factor in making the intended referent salient is the fact that it verifies a
piece of immediately preceding discourse. 14

Both of these objections deserve serious consideration before we can be sure that the
ability of indefinites to serve as antecedents for anaphoric pronouns beyond their scope
is indeed a symptom of the non-quantificational nature of indefinites. I will have to be
brief here. 15 My answer to both objections is that the alternative accounts they give of
the anaphoric relation between "a soldier" and "he" in (28) do not carry over to certain
other examples of an analogous nature. Consider (29)
(29) Every time a soldier accompanies us he shoots

Under a quantificational analysis of indefinites, (29) ought to get the following logical
analysis:
(29')
8t (9x i (soldier (x i) & (x i accompanies us at t)) ~> (x j shoots at t))

Unlike in the case of (28), the truth-conditions of (29) are clearly inconsistent with
an alternative analysis under which "a soldier" takes wide enough scope to include x j . 1!=

This shows that if a quantificational analysis of indefinites is to be reconciled with their
behavior w.r.t. anaphora, it will not suffice to appeal to their unconstrained scope
options

But (29) also doesn't lend itself to an account in terms of the sort of quasi-deictic use
of "he" that had some plausibility for examples like (28). The problem is that the "he"
in (29) fails to refer, and that deixis without reference is a contradiction in terms by all
available explications of the concept

So (29), more compellingly than (28), shows that indefinites enter into anaphoric
relations where this is not to be expected from the point of view of a quantificational
analysis. I have yet to show that the non-quantificational alternative that I am develop-
ing in this article covers examples like (29) in a natural way. This leads us to the topic of
quantification

This is similar to the "predication condition" of May (1977)





7. May (1977) makes this assumption only for quantifying NPs, whereas I extend it to all predicate-
headed NPs, quantifying or not







Heim (1983) argues that this view of what presuppositions are throws light on the behavior of
presuppositions with respect to the so-called "projection problem"







See Heim (1982)

11. When I say (here and elsewhere in this article) that the indefinite is not a
 =   quantifier, I am of course not using "quantifier" in the sense of Barwise
 =   and Cooper (1981). In their sense of "quantifier", anything that denotes a
 =   function from predicate-meanings to proposition-meanings is a quantifier,
 =   and every kind of NP, even proper names and pronouns, can therefore be
 =   construed as quantifiers
12. = The relevant notion of "vacuity" could be defined as follows:







Def.: Let p be a formula, x a variable, and A the set of all occurrences of x in p. Suppose B and C are
two disjoint subsets of A, with A = B \cup C. Then the members of B are vacuously coindexed
with the members of C iff for some variable y = x, p and p' have identical satisfaction
conditions; where p' results from p by substituting y for every occurrence of x that is in C







Note that the "law" under (27) in the text is not a definition of vacuity, but rather a theorem that
follows from the definition above, given the standard interpretation of quantifiers. This is why
one could not simply choose to replace (27) by a stipulation that permits certain quantifiers to be
coindexed non-vacuously with variables beyond their scope ~~ unless one were to use logic as an
uninterpreted formalism altogether







This is basically what Geach (19!=2) suggests







This line is taken by Kripke (1977), Lewis (1979), and elsewhere







For more careful argumentation, see Heim (1982, Ch. 1), where I also address a third way of
undermining the use of (28) as evidence against the quantificational analysis of indefinites,
advocated by Evans (1977) and Cooper (1979), among others.File Change Semantics

1!= Unless one assumes, moreover, that the wide-scope taking indefinite switches its quantificational
force from existential to universal. That assumption has been pursued in Egli (1979) and Smaby
(1979), whose proposals are discussed in depth in Heim (1982, Ch. 1)
17 The example is from Kamp (1981), whose treatment of quantification (designed to go with his
version of the non-quantificational analysis of indefinites) made me aware that I had overlooked
cases like (33) in a earlier version of my theory
