# Abstract
	
* Positive polarity items (PPIs) are generally thought not to scope below neg
* we: their distribution is significantly more complex
  * someone/something-type PPIs share properties with negative polarity items
    * disallowed in the same environments that license _yet_ type NPIs; second,
    * adding any NPI-licenser rescues the illegitimate constellation
* conclusion that these PPIs have the combined properties of
  yet-type and ever-type NPIs
  * what appears to be a prohibition is nothing but “halfway licensing”
* we propose a unification of the analyses of
  rescuable PPIs, NPIs, and negative concord, and
  * questions the grounding of polarity sensitivity in the
    scalar or the referential semantics of the items involved

# 1. NPIs and PPIs – do they have much in common?

* two broad categories of polarity sensitive expressions
* the crudest characterization, NPIs must, and PPIs must not, occur in the scope
  of negation
(1) I `*`(don’t) see anything
(2) I (`*`don’t) see something
  `*` unless _some_ > _not_, or _not_ is an emphatic denial
* is the reference to the scope of negation in the two defs a signif commonal?
  1. the relation between negation and
    * _any_ is syntactic or semantic licensing a respectable grammatical phenom
    * _some_ seems like a boring prohibition, or a matter of pragmatic prefer
  2. NPIs come in many flavors (Zwarts 1981), whereas
    PPIs seem to single-mindedly avoid scoping below a particular operator
* 2. is only apparent
  * Van der Wouden (1997) observes that the three classical types of NPIs are
    matched by three comparable types of PPIs in Dutch (sem defs in sec 2)
  * examples Outside Dutch
    * (3a) by pakkey 'only’ (an exceptive, Nam 1994),
      (3b) by English yet, and
      (3c) by English ever
(3) NPIs Must be in the scope of
  * an antimorphic operator: mals 'tender’, pluis 'plush’
  * an antiadditive operator: ook maar 'also but = any’,
    hand voor ogen 'hand before eyes’, met een vinger 'with a finger’
  * a decreasing operator: hoeven 'need’
(4) PPIs Must not be in the scope of
  * an antimorphic operator: al 'already’, nog 'still’
  * an antiadditive operator: een beetje 'a little’, nogal 'rather’, maar 'but’
  * a decreasing operator: allerminst 'not-at-all’, niet 'not’
* the above NPI typology is
  * not exhaustive (some NPIs are licensed in non-veridical contexts)
  * not uncontroversial (decreasingness needs to be taken with a grain of salt)
  * much parallelism
* NPIs and PPIs sensitive to (at least roughly) the same semantic properties?
  * van der Wouden’s 1997 very general framework of collocational behavior
    * semantic notions like downward monotonicity and antiadditivity play a role
    * would make it surprising if NPIs did not have PPI counterparts
2. recall that NPIs and PPIs are thought to differ in licensing vs prohibition
  * Progovac (2000) has made a proposal to bring PPIs into the licensing fold
  * PPIs are licensed in a non-negative polarity phrase that is
    located above the negative polarity phrase in clause structure;
  * therefore, if the clause happens to contain a negation,
    the PPI automatically scopes above the neg
  * I show that PPIs cannot in general be required to scope above negation and
    * I offer an alternative characterization of PPIs in licensing terms
3. noted by Jespersen: while (5) is unacceptable on the 'not > some’ reading,
   the same reading is available in (6):
   (5) You didn’t see something
   (6) I don’t believe that you didn’t see something
  * Jespersen: because the two negations cancel out (I believe that you saw sg)
  * Baker (1970)
    * other elements, e.g. adversative predicates, have the same effect and
    * a polarity-switching mechanism that generalizes Jespersen’s idea
    * I show that this idea cannot be correct
  * My own explanation exploits the NPI—PPI parallelism
* In this paper I provide a detailed description of the behavior of
  PPIs of the sort _someone_ and _something_
  * two main arguments
  * In the first part of the paper I argue that these PPIs are double NPIs
    * They simultaneously exhibit the licensing needs of classes (3b) and (3c)
    * they have both a yet-feature and an ever-feature
    * These features are “dormant”, unless “activated” by a yet-licensing envir
    * a yet-licensor activates both features but licenses only one of them
    * Therefore the ever-feature requires the presence of a second licenser
  * The second argument offers a way to make sense of dormant features & activat
    * related to the proposals in
      * de Swart and Sag’s 2002 for negative concord and
      * Postal 2000a,b for _any_ and _no_
    * NPI-features are to be interpreted as negations
    * Dormancy occurs when the two negations simply cancel out semantically
    * Licensing is effected by resumptive quantification
    * my description fills gaps in Postal’s system
* Finally, I consider the idea that the characteristics of NPIs and PPIs are
  intimately linked to a scalar or a referential semantics

Part One: PPIs as double NPIs 4

# 2. Refining the description of the distribution of PPIs 4

* reasons to focus on someone/something type PPIs. First,
  * they belong to the by far largest class of PPIs, those
    sensitive to antiadditive operators (cf. van der Wouden’s class (4b)), but
    within this class, their lexical semantics is straightforward
    as compared to that of _would rather, would just as soon_, etc. Second,
  * they do not very easily act as specific indefinites and therefore
    * allow us to separate
      the extra-wide scoping abilities of specific indefinites
      from the par excellence PPI-restriction vis-a-vis negation.  Third, these
  * they are “rescuable” in the sense of (6) => an interesting combo of properts
  * their properties appear to be shared by various PPIs in other lang, eg Hun
* not address the cross-linguistic variation in the inventory of PPIs. For
  * Szabolcsi 2002 observes that
  * in Hungarian and in various other languages, (the counterparts of)
    a(n)-phrases and disjunctions exhibit the same PPI-properties as some-Ps,
    whereas _or_ contrasts with _some_ in English. 3
* notation
  * if acceptable on the 'some > not’ reading
    but, crucially, not on the `not > some’ reading
    will attach the asterisk to the interpretation, not to the string itself.

## 2.1 PPIs and denial/contrast 5

* PPIs can in fact occur within the immediate scope of clausemate negation
  if the latter is construed as
  an emphatic denial of a similarly phrased statement, e.g.: 4
* must be controlled for. One useful method may be to
  * judge the negated clause in the context of a why-question, which helps
    Why did John look so disappointed?
    Because he didn’t find something.
    `*` not > some
* contrast, not just denial, may be the more appropriate categ (Schwarzschild).
  * e.g. focused and something is unstressed, the `not>some’ reading is fully
    _If you push the red button, you will see something, but if you press the
    blue button you WON’T see something._

## 2.2 PPIs cannot take narrower scope than what?

* not specifically negation that our chosen PPIs are sensitive to. Consider the
* _some_ cannot be in the immediate scope of a negative quantifier or _without,_
* OK below _at most five_
  (10) John didn' t call someone. * not > some
  (11) No one called someone. * no one > some
  (12) John came to the party without someone. * without > some
  (13) At most five boys called someone. √ at most 5 > some
* difference:
  * some/without are antiadditive but the latter are merely decreasing
  * decreasing iff, given A≤B, f(B)≤f(A).
  * antiadditive iff f(a ∨ b) = fa ∧ fb.
  * antimorphic iff antiadditive and additionally f(a ∧ b)=fa ∨ fb,
    i.e. iff f is classical negation.  
* e.g. _no one_ but not _at most five boys_ exhibits the antiadditive
  _ At most five boys walk or talk != At most five boys walk and =<5 boys talk 
* _some_ can scope below an antiadditive (ie not) if it is not in its immed
  scope (Kroch 1979), Nem azért
  (19) John didn’t offend someone because he was malicious (but because he was
  stupid).  √ not > because ... > some
* PPIs can scope below extraclausal negation and other extraclausal NPI-licensor
  * I remain agnostic as to the precise category specification. 
  (24) I don't think that John called someone. 6 √ not > [ CP/IP some
  * some is interchangeable with any, in the sense that
    on the relevant reading (24) is truth-conditionally equivalent to (28),
    although the _some_ sentence lacks the “widening plus strengthening” flavor
* In the intervention cases, _some_ cannot be replaced by _any_ because
  * ~ is blocked by the interveners (Kroch 1979, Linebarger 1987)
    * the licensing of any 
    * negation prohibition some
    csJohn doesn’t always call anyone.
    not > always > any
* All the parallel observations hold in Hungarian for
  indef pronouns formed with _vala-_, NPs with _egy_ and disjunctions _vagy_
* whether the clausemate versus extraclausal contrast has to do with the
  intervention of the matrix predicate
  * The following data suggest that it is just a locality matter:
  * (30) John won without help from someone.   * without > some
    (31) John won without someone helping him. √ without > [ CP/IP some
* To summarize, the generalization so far is this:
  * Some-type PPIs do not occur within the immediate scope of a clausemate
    antiadditive operator
  * Schematically: *[AA-Op > PPI]

## 2.3 ... unless [AA-Op > PPI] itself is in an NPI-licensing context

* i.e. PPIs within the immediate scope of a clausemate antiadditive operator 
* Baker 1970, who discussed matrix negation, _no one_ and adversative
  predicates, pointed out that data like (33) were already noted by Jespersen:
  (33) I don't think that John didn't call someone. √ not > not > some
  (34) No one thinks that John didn’t call someone. √ no one > not > some
  (35) I am surprised that John didn't call someone. √ surprise > not > some
  (36) I regret that John didn’t call someone. √ regret > not > some
* that all contexts that license weak (ever-type) NPIs enable the PPI to
  scope directly below clausemate negation:
  (37) If we don't call someone, we are doomed. √ if (not > some)
  (38) Every boy who didn’t call someone... √ every (not > some)
  (39) Only John didn't call someone. √ only > not > some
  (40) Few boys didn't call someone. √ few > not > some
  (41) Few boys thought that you didn’t call someone. √ few > not > some
* the full description is this: 
  PPIs do not occur in the immediate scope of a clausemate antiadditive operator
  AA-Op, unless [AA-Op > PPI] itself is in an NPI-licensing context.
* “immediate” means that there is no scopal intervener.
* more exotic members of the class like _would rather_ share similar properties.
  (43) *John wouldn’t rather eat Chinese
  (44) John wouldn’t always rather eat Chinese
  (45) I am surprised that John wouldn’t rather eat Chinese

# 3. Questions 12

46. Why are PPIs prohibited in the immediate scope of a clausemate antiadd op?
47. How can this prohibition be represented as a positive licensing requirement?
48. Why is the illegitimate constellation rescuable by an NPI-licensing context?
* 47, 48, 46

# 4. Are PPIs forced to scope above clausemate negation?

* 47? Because PPIs are for independent reasons forced to scope above clama AA-Op
* Serbo-Croatian PPI ne(t)ko 'someone' , Progovac proposes 
* a PPI has a syntactic feature [-neg] to be checked in a compatible PolarityP
  * there are two polarity phrases, the
    * lower one typically associated with sentential negation particles ie NegP,
    * higher one typically associated with other types of polarity information.
  * Since the PPI in [John did not see someone] cannot check in the lower neg,
    it is forced to raise to the higher PolP" (Progovac 2000)
  * various elegant consequences
* reasons to look further for an explanation.  
  * as seen above, these PPIs happily scope below even clausemate negation if
    * another operator scopally intervenes between negation and the PPI, or 
      (49) John didn’t offend someone because he was malicious (but because he was stupid).
           √ not > because ... > some
           (50) John didn’t say something at every party. √ not > every > some
           (51) I regret that John didn’t call someone. √ regret > not > some
           (52) If we don' t call someone, we are doomed. √ if (not > some) 
      * Neither of these possibilities should be available if the PPI was forced
        to scope above NegP, the locus of negation.
    * the [negation > PPI] unit is in an NPI-licensing context 
      * Progovac discusses cases like type (ii), but evaluates them differently.
      * the PPI scopes above the clausemate negation though below the extraclausal one:
      (53) Ne tvrdim da Milan nekoga ne voli.
           _I don' t claim of someone that Milan does not like him_
           `There is no person of whom I claim that Milan does not like him`
      * the reading Progovac attributes to (53) is different from the one we are
        interested in: it is
        'not>some>not’, i.e. 'every’, rather than 'not>not>some’, i.e. 'some’.
* Progovac’s account seems to rest on the tacit assumption that PPIs are
  specific indefinites in the sense that
  they are headed for a relatively high position in clausal structure and 
  can scope above negation to begin with. But
  there are PPIs that are clearly not like that. Take
  non-referential expressions such as
  objects of creation verbs and measure phrases, which are
  sensitive to negative islands
* The following sentences are strange or unacceptable, because
  the PPI character of the expression is incompatible with narrow scope, whereas
  its negative island sensitive character prevents it from scoping above neg
  (54) *John doesn’t appreciate this somewhat. 
  (55) ??John didn’t take some time off.
  (56) ??John didn’t come up with something.
* Such PPIs, however, are perfectly happy when an NPI-licensor is added, showing
  * neg > PPIs
    (57) I regret that John doesn’t appreciate this somewhat.
         If John doesn’t appreciate this somewhat...
         '... to any extent’ 
    (58) I regret that John didn’t take some time off.
         If John didn’t take some time off...
         '... any time’ 
    (59) I regret that John didn’t come up with something.
         If John didn’t come up with something...
         '... anything’ 
* similar contrasts with verbal disjunctions in Hungarian, which
  * never scope above their own negation, hence they cannot scope between the
    two negations: 14 (60)
    János nem evett vagy aludt.
    *'John didn' t eat or didn' t sleep'
    (only 'either John didn' t eat or John slept' ) 
    Nem hiszem, hogy János ne evett vagy aludt volna'
    not > not > or
* moral
  * study the PPI phenomenon using expressions
    that are unable to scope above clausemate negation.
    * PPIs functioning as specific indefinites have extra possibilities that are
  * the desired positive (licensing) statement of the PPI-generalization
    cannot simply force the PPI to invariably scope in a position above negation

# 5. Rescuing by an NPI-licensor is NPI-licensing 15

* why NPI-licensing contexts enable the PPI to scope immediately under a loc neg
* Jespersen’s answer was that when an extra negation is added, the two negations
  cancel out and the PPI is in an innocuous positive context.  If this
  * semantically trivial and offer no further insight into the PPI phenomenon.

## 5.1 Is the cancelling-out account of rescuing tenable? 15

* whether Jespersen’s suggestion might extend to the rescuing effect
  of the full set of NPI-licensors.
* Strawson-decreasingness 
  * characterizes the entailment relations between sentences
    when their presuppositions are fulfilled
    (62) I regret that John ate a vegetable.
    (63) I regret that John ate spinach.
  * (62) does not entail (63), because John may have eaten cabbage, not spinach,
  * But if the vegetable John ate happened to be spinach, then yes
    * the contribution of regret itself is a decreasing one.
* rescuing:
  (64) I regret that John didn’t come up with something scary.
  ?regret > some > not
  * redefining “positive” as “Strawson-increasing”?
  * The entailment probably goes through; similarly for only, analyzed along the
  * If so, then if von Fintel’s approach is generally successful and
    * being in a Strawson-increasing environment licenses our PPIs
    * then Jespersen’s proposal extends to the full set of rescuers.
* I will argue, however, that the rescuing phenomenon is not what the above
  * other relevant examples that cannot be accounted for in this way
  * The above argument rests on that PPIs are sensitive to the
    monotonicity properties of the full context in which they occur. (The
    * cancelling = the two decreasing functions are composed into an increasing
  * hE, PPIs are only allergic to clausemate negation and are happy within the
  * if we add a further negation on top of the rescuer and thereby
    switch the polarity of the context, the PPI remains happy: (70) I don’t
  * the above account makes incorrect predictions concerning the range of
    possible rescuers. Recall one of the basic facts about the
    * PPIs at hand: they
      * cannot scope immediately below a local antiadditive but they do
      * can be in the immediate scope of a merely decreasing local operator.
      (71) ?* No one came up with something.
      (72) At most five people came up with something.
    * the local context is simply decreasing the PPI will still be rescued?
    * Szabolcsi and Zwarts 1990 observe that given two functions f and g, where
      g is antiadditive, their composition f ° g i.e. λx[f(gx)] is antiadditive
      iff f is multiplicative, viz.  f(a∧b)=fa∧fb. The following informal
    * e.g.
      * g = Negation: doesn’t walk or talk is equivalent to doesn’t walk and doesn
      * f = John is multiplicative: John A and B is the same as John A and John B;
      * f = More than two men is not multiplicative: More than two men A and B is
        * the composed function more than two men don’t [verb] is just decreasing.
    * If extending the context by means of function composition is a possible
      means of rescuing the PPI,
      then we predict that adding more than two men above the offending
      antiadditive rescues the PPI as much as adding an NPI-licensor does.
    * This prediction is just wrong: (73)
      ?* More than two men didn’t come up with something.
      cannot mean `More than two men came up with nothing’ 
* In sum: the rescuing effect cannot be due to context extension.  

John didn’t come up with something.
* not > some
