# Abstract
	
* Positive polarity items (PPIs) are generally thought to have the boring
  * cannot scope below negation. The starting point of the paper is the
* we: their distribution is significantly more complex; specifically,
  * someone/something-type PPIs share properties with negative polarity items
    * disallowed in the same environments that license yet type NPIs; second,
    * adding any NPI-licenser rescues the illegitimate constellation. This leads
* conclusion that these PPIs have the combined properties of
  yet-type and ever-type NPIs
  * what appears to be a prohibition is nothing but “halfway licensing”. The
* we propose a unification of the analyses of
  rescuable PPIs, NPIs, and negative concord, and
  * questions the grounding of polarity sensitivity in the
    scalar or the referential semantics of the items involved

# 1. NPIs and PPIs – do they have much in common?

* two broad categories of polarity sensitive expressions
* the crudest characterization, NPIs must, and PPIs must not, occur in the scope
  of negation. For instance:
(1) I `*`(don’t) see anything
(2) I (`*`don’t) see something
  `*` unless _some_ > _not_, or _not_ is an emphatic denial

* reference to the scope of negation in the two definitions a significant? comm
  1. the relation between negation and
    * _any_ is syntactic or semantic licensing
    an altogether respectable kind of grammatical phenomenon, whereas
    * _some_ seems like a boring prohibition, or a matter of pragmatic prefer
  2. NPIs come in many flavors (Zwarts 1981 and subsequent literature), whereas
    PPIs seem to singlemindedly avoid scoping below a particular operator. If
* 2. is only apparent
  * Van der Wouden (1997) observes that the three classical types of NPIs are
    matched by three comparable types of PPIs in Dutch (sem defs in sec 2)
  * examples Outside Dutch
    * (3a) by pakkey 'only’ (an exceptive, Nam 1994),
      (3b) by English yet, and
      (3c) by English ever, for example
(3) NPIs Must be in the scope of
  * an antimorphic operator: mals 'tender’, pluis 'plush’
  * an antiadditive operator: ook maar 'also but = any’, hand voor ogen 'hand
    before eyes’, met een vinger 'with a finger’
  * a decreasing operator: hoeven 'need’3
(4) PPIs Must not be in the scope of
  * an antimorphic operator: al 'already’, nog 'still’
  * an antiadditive operator: een beetje 'a little’, nogal 'rather’, maar 'but’
  * a decreasing operator: allerminst 'not-at-all’, niet 'not’
* the above NPI typology is
  * not exhaustive (some NPIs are licensed in non-veridical contexts Giannakidou 98)
  * not uncontroversial (decreasingness needs to be taken with a grain of salt)
  * much parallelism
* NPIs and PPIs sensitive to (at least roughly) the same semantic properties?
  * van der Wouden’s 1997 very general framework of collocational behavior, the
    * semantic notions like downward monotonicity and antiadditivity play a role
    * would make it surprising if NPIs did not have PPI counterparts. This,
2. recall that NPIs and PPIs are thought to differ along the dimension of
  licensing versus prohibition
  * Progovac 2000 has made a proposal to bring PPIs into the licensing fold
  * PPIs are licensed in a non-negative polarity phrase that is located above
    the negative polarity phrase in clause structure;
  * therefore, if the clause happens to contain a negation, the PPI
    automatically scopes above it
  * I show that PPIs cannot in general be required to scope above negation and
    offer an alternative characterization of PPIs in licensing terms
3. noted by Jespersen: while (5) is unacceptable on the 'not>some’ reading, the
   same reading is available in (6):
   (5) You didn’t see something
   (6) I don’t believe that you didn’t see something
  * Jespersen. because the two negations cancel out (I believe that you saw sg)
  * Baker 1970 noticed that
    other elements, e.g.  adversative predicates, have the same effect and
    developed a polarity-switching mechanism that generalizes Jespersen’s idea
  * I show that this idea cannot be correct
  * My own explanation exploits the NPI—PPI parallelism
* In this paper I provide a detailed description of the behavior of PPIs of the
  sort someone and something, and make
  * two main arguments
  * In the first part of the paper I argue that these PPIs are double NPIs. They
    simultaneously exhibit the licensing needs of both class (3b) and class (3c)
    * they have both a yet-feature and an ever-feature
    * These features are “dormant”, unless “activated” by a yet-licensing envir
    * a yet-licensor activates both features but licenses only one of them
    * Therefore the ever-feature requires the presence of a second licenser
  * The second argument offers a way to make sense of dormant features & activat
    * related to the proposals in
      * de Swart and Sag’s 2002 for negative concord and in
      * Postal 2000a,b for any and no
    * that NPI-features are to be interpreted as negations
    * Dormancy occurs when the two negations simply cancel out semantically
      Licensing is effected by resumptive quantification. The
      activation/licensing pattern of _some_ turns out to fill gaps in Postal’s
      system postulated for any and no
* Finally, I consider the idea that the characteristics of NPIs and PPIs are
  intimately linked to a scalar or a referential semantics
