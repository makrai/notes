# Abstract
	
* Positive polarity items (PPIs) are generally thought not to scope below neg
* we: their distribution is significantly more complex
  * someone/something-type PPIs share properties with negative polarity items
    * disallowed in the same environments that license _yet_ type NPIs; second,
    * adding any NPI-licenser rescues the illegitimate constellation
* conclusion that these PPIs have the combined properties of
  yet-type and ever-type NPIs
  * what appears to be a prohibition is nothing but “halfway licensing”
* we propose a unification of the analyses of
  rescuable PPIs, NPIs, and negative concord, and
  * questions the grounding of polarity sensitivity in the
    scalar or the referential semantics of the items involved

# 1. NPIs and PPIs – do they have much in common?

* two broad categories of polarity sensitive expressions
* the crudest characterization, NPIs must, and PPIs must not, occur in the scope
  of negation
(1) I `*`(don’t) see anything
(2) I (`*`don’t) see something
  `*` unless _some_ > _not_, or _not_ is an emphatic denial
* is the reference to the scope of negation in the two defs a signif commonal?
  1. the relation between negation and
    * _any_ is syntactic or semantic licensing a respectable grammatical phenom
    * _some_ seems like a boring prohibition, or a matter of pragmatic prefer
  2. NPIs come in many flavors (Zwarts 1981), whereas
    PPIs seem to single-mindedly avoid scoping below a particular operator
* 2. is only apparent
  * Van der Wouden (1997) observes that the three classical types of NPIs are
    matched by three comparable types of PPIs in Dutch (sem defs in sec 2)
  * examples Outside Dutch
    * (3a) by pakkey 'only’ (an exceptive, Nam 1994),
      (3b) by English yet, and
      (3c) by English ever
(3) NPIs Must be in the scope of
  * an antimorphic operator: mals 'tender’, pluis 'plush’
  * an antiadditive operator: ook maar 'also but = any’,
    hand voor ogen 'hand before eyes’, met een vinger 'with a finger’
  * a decreasing operator: hoeven 'need’
(4) PPIs Must not be in the scope of
  * an antimorphic operator: al 'already’, nog 'still’
  * an antiadditive operator: een beetje 'a little’, nogal 'rather’, maar 'but’
  * a decreasing operator: allerminst 'not-at-all’, niet 'not’
* the above NPI typology is
  * not exhaustive (some NPIs are licensed in non-veridical contexts)
  * not uncontroversial (decreasingness needs to be taken with a grain of salt)
  * much parallelism
* NPIs and PPIs sensitive to (at least roughly) the same semantic properties?
  * van der Wouden’s 1997 very general framework of collocational behavior
    * semantic notions like downward monotonicity and antiadditivity play a role
    * would make it surprising if NPIs did not have PPI counterparts
2. recall that NPIs and PPIs are thought to differ in licensing vs prohibition
  * Progovac (2000) has made a proposal to bring PPIs into the licensing fold
  * PPIs are licensed in a non-negative polarity phrase that is
    located above the negative polarity phrase in clause structure;
  * therefore, if the clause happens to contain a negation,
    the PPI automatically scopes above the neg
  * I show that PPIs cannot in general be required to scope above negation and
    * I offer an alternative characterization of PPIs in licensing terms
3. noted by Jespersen: while (5) is unacceptable on the 'not > some’ reading,
   the same reading is available in (6):
   (5) You didn’t see something
   (6) I don’t believe that you didn’t see something
  * Jespersen: because the two negations cancel out (I believe that you saw sg)
  * Baker (1970)
    * other elements, e.g. adversative predicates, have the same effect and
    * a polarity-switching mechanism that generalizes Jespersen’s idea
    * I show that this idea cannot be correct
  * My own explanation exploits the NPI—PPI parallelism
* In this paper I provide a detailed description of the behavior of
  PPIs of the sort _someone_ and _something_
  * two main arguments
  * In the first part of the paper I argue that these PPIs are double NPIs
    * They simultaneously exhibit the licensing needs of classes (3b) and (3c)
    * they have both a yet-feature and an ever-feature
    * These features are “dormant”, unless “activated” by a yet-licensing envir
    * a yet-licensor activates both features but licenses only one of them
    * Therefore the ever-feature requires the presence of a second licenser
  * The second argument offers a way to make sense of dormant features & activat
    * related to the proposals in
      * de Swart and Sag’s 2002 for negative concord and
      * Postal 2000a,b for _any_ and _no_
    * NPI-features are to be interpreted as negations
    * Dormancy occurs when the two negations simply cancel out semantically
    * Licensing is effected by resumptive quantification
    * my description fills gaps in Postal’s system
* Finally, I consider the idea that the characteristics of NPIs and PPIs are
  intimately linked to a scalar or a referential semantics

Part One: PPIs as double NPIs 4

# 2. Refining the description of the distribution of PPIs 4

* reasons to focus on someone/something type PPIs. First,
  * they belong to the by far largest class of PPIs, those sensitive to
    antiadditive operators (cf. van der Wouden’s class (4b)), but within this
    class, their lexical semantics is straightforward as compared to that of
    _would rather, would just as soon_, etc. Second,
  * they do not very easily act as specific indefinites and therefore
    * allow us to separate the extra-wide scoping abilities of specific
      indefinites from the par excellence PPI-restriction vis-a-vis negation.
      Third, these
  * they are “rescuable” in the sense of (6) => an interesting combo of properts
  * their properties appear to be shared by various PPIs in other lang, eg Hun
* not address the cross-linguistic variation in the inventory of PPIs. For
  * Szabolcsi 2002 observes that
  * in Hungarian and in various other languages, (the counterparts of)
    a(n)-phrases and disjunctions exhibit the same PPI-properties as some-Ps,
    whereas _or_ contrasts with _some_ in English. 3
* notation
  * if acceptable on the 'some > not’ reading but, crucially, not on the `not >
    some’ reading will attach the asterisk to the interpretation, not to the
    string itself.

## 2.1 PPIs and denial/contrast 5

* PPIs can in fact occur within the immediate scope of clausemate negation if
  the latter is construed as an emphatic denial of a similarly phrased
  statement, e.g.: 4
* must be controlled for. One useful method may be to
  * judge the negated clause in the context of a why-question, which helps Why
    did John look so disappointed?  Because he didn’t find something.  `*` not >
    some
* contrast, not just denial, may be the more appropriate categ (Schwarzschild).
  * e.g. focused and something is unstressed, the `not>some’ reading is fully
    _If you push the red button, you will see something, but if you press the
    blue button you WON’T see something._

## 2.2 PPIs cannot take narrower scope than what?

* not specifically negation that our chosen PPIs are sensitive to. Consider the
* _some_ cannot be in the immediate scope of a negative quantifier or _without,_
* OK below _at most five_ (10) John didn' t call someone. * not > some (11) No
  one called someone. * no one > some (12) John came to the party without
  someone. * without > some (13) At most five boys called someone. √ at most 5 >
  some
* difference:
  * some/without are antiadditive but the latter are merely decreasing
  * decreasing iff, given A≤B, f(B)≤f(A).
  * antiadditive iff f(a ∨ b) = fa ∧ fb.
  * antimorphic iff antiadditive and additionally f(a ∧ b)=fa ∨ fb, i.e. iff f
    is classical negation.
* e.g. _no one_ but not _at most five boys_ exhibits the antiadditive _ At most
  five boys walk or talk != At most five boys walk and =<5 boys talk
* _some_ can scope below an antiadditive (ie not) if it is not in its immed
  scope (Kroch 1979), Nem azért (19) John didn’t offend someone because he was
  malicious (but because he was stupid).  √ not > because ... > some
* PPIs can scope below extraclausal negation and other extraclausal NPI-licensor
  * I remain agnostic as to the precise category specification.  (24) I don't
    think that John called someone. 6 √ not > [ CP/IP some
  * some is interchangeable with any, in the sense that on the relevant reading
    (24) is truth-conditionally equivalent to (28), although the _some_ sentence
    lacks the “widening plus strengthening” flavor
* In the intervention cases, _some_ cannot be replaced by _any_ because
  * ~ is blocked by the interveners (Kroch 1979, Linebarger 1987)
    * the licensing of any
    * negation prohibition some csJohn doesn’t always call anyone.  not > always
      > any
* All the parallel observations hold in Hungarian for indef pronouns formed with
  _vala-_, NPs with _egy_ and disjunctions _vagy_
* whether the clausemate versus extraclausal contrast has to do with the
  intervention of the matrix predicate
  * The following data suggest that it is just a locality matter:
  * (30) John won without help from someone.   * without > some (31) John won
    without someone helping him. √ without > [ CP/IP some
* To summarize, the generalization so far is this:
  * Some-type PPIs do not occur within the immediate scope of a clausemate
    antiadditive operator
  * Schematically: *[AA-Op > PPI]

## 2.3 ... unless [AA-Op > PPI] itself is in an NPI-licensing context

* i.e. PPIs within the immediate scope of a clausemate antiadditive operator
* Baker 1970, who discussed matrix negation, _no one_ and adversative
  predicates, pointed out that data like (33) were already noted by Jespersen:
  (33) I don't think that John didn't call someone. √ not > not > some (34) No
  one thinks that John didn’t call someone. √ no one > not > some (35) I am
  surprised that John didn't call someone. √ surprise > not > some (36) I regret
  that John didn’t call someone. √ regret > not > some
* that all contexts that license weak (ever-type) NPIs enable the PPI to scope
  directly below clausemate negation: (37) If we don't call someone, we are
  doomed. √ if (not > some) (38) Every boy who didn’t call someone... √ every
  (not > some) (39) Only John didn't call someone. √ only > not > some (40) Few
  boys didn't call someone. √ few > not > some (41) Few boys thought that you
  didn’t call someone. √ few > not > some
* the full description is this: PPIs do not occur in the immediate scope of a
  clausemate antiadditive operator AA-Op, unless [AA-Op > PPI] itself is in an
  NPI-licensing context.
* “immediate” means that there is no scopal intervener.
* more exotic members of the class like _would rather_ share similar properties.
  (43) *John wouldn’t rather eat Chinese (44) John wouldn’t always rather eat
  Chinese (45) I am surprised that John wouldn’t rather eat Chinese

# 3. Questions 12

46. Why are PPIs prohibited in the immediate scope of a clausemate antiadd op?
47. How can this prohibition be represented as a positive licensing requirement?
48. Why is the illegitimate constellation rescuable by an NPI-licensing context?
* 47, 48, 46

# 4. Are PPIs forced to scope above clausemate negation?

* 47? Because PPIs are for independent reasons forced to scope above clama AA-Op
* Serbo-Croatian PPI ne(t)ko 'someone' , Progovac proposes
* a PPI has a syntactic feature [-neg] to be checked in a compatible PolarityP
  * there are two polarity phrases, the
    * lower one typically associated with sentential negation particles ie NegP,
    * higher one typically associated with other types of polarity information.
  * Since the PPI in [John did not see someone] cannot check in the lower neg,
    it is forced to raise to the higher PolP" (Progovac 2000)
  * various elegant consequences
* reasons to look further for an explanation.
  * as seen above, these PPIs happily scope below even clausemate negation if
    * another operator scopally intervenes between negation and the PPI, or (49)
      John didn’t offend someone because he was malicious (but because he was
      stupid).  √ not > because ... > some (50) John didn’t say something at
      every party. √ not > every > some (51) I regret that John didn’t call
      someone. √ regret > not > some (52) If we don' t call someone, we are
      doomed. √ if (not > some)
      * Neither of these possibilities should be available if the PPI was forced
        to scope above NegP, the locus of negation.
    * the [negation > PPI] unit is in an NPI-licensing context
      * Progovac discusses cases like type (ii), but evaluates them differently.
      * the PPI scopes above the clausemate negation though below the
        extraclausal one: (53) Ne tvrdim da Milan nekoga ne voli.  _I don' t
        claim of someone that Milan does not like him_ `There is no person of
        whom I claim that Milan does not like him`
      * the reading Progovac attributes to (53) is different from the one we are
        interested in: it is 'not>some>not’, i.e. 'every’, rather than
        'not>not>some’, i.e. 'some’.
* Progovac’s account seems to rest on the tacit assumption that
  PPIs are specific indefinites in the sense that
  they are headed for a relatively high position in clausal structure and
  can scope above negation to begin with
  * But there are PPIs that are clearly not like that
    eg non-referential expressions
    such as objects of creation verbs and measure phrases,
    which are sensitive to negative islands
* The following sentences are strange or unacceptable, because the PPI character
  of the expression is incompatible with narrow scope, whereas its negative
  island sensitive character prevents it from scoping above neg (54) *John
  doesn’t appreciate this somewhat.  (55) ??John didn’t take some time off.
  (56) ??John didn’t come up with something.
* Such PPIs, however, are perfectly happy when an NPI-licensor is added, showing
  * neg > PPIs (57) I regret that John doesn’t appreciate this somewhat.  If
    John doesn’t appreciate this somewhat...  '... to any extent’ (58) I regret
    that John didn’t take some time off.  If John didn’t take some time off...
    '... any time’ (59) I regret that John didn’t come up with something.  If
    John didn’t come up with something...  '... anything’
* similar contrasts with verbal disjunctions in Hungarian, which
  * never scope above their own negation, hence they cannot scope between the
    two negations: 14 (60) János nem evett vagy aludt.  *'John didn' t eat or
    didn' t sleep' (only 'either John didn' t eat or John slept' ) Nem hiszem,
    hogy János ne evett vagy aludt volna' not > not > or
* moral
  * study the PPI phenomenon using
    expressions that are unable to scope above clausemate negation.
    * PPIs functioning as specific indefinites have extra possibilities that are
  * the desired positive (licensing) statement of the PPI-generalization cannot
    simply force the PPI to invariably scope in a position above negation

# 5. Rescuing by an NPI-licensor is NPI-licensing 15

* why NPI-licensing contexts enable the PPI to scope immediately under a loc neg
* Jespersen’s answer was that when an extra negation is added, the two negations
  cancel out and the PPI is in an innocuous (OK) posit context
  * semantically trivial and offer no further insight into the PPI phenomenon.

## 5.1 Is the cancelling-out account of rescuing tenable? 15

* whether Jespersen’s suggestion might extend to the rescuing effect of the full
  set of NPI-licensors.
* Von Fintel 1999: NPI-licensors can all be analyzed as (at least) Strawson-decr
* Strawson-decreasingness
  * characterizes the entailment relations between sentences when their
    presuppositions are fulfilled (62/63) I regret that John ate a
    vegetable/spinach
  * (62) does not entail (63), because John may have eaten cabbage, not spinach,
  * But if the vegetable John ate happened to be spinach, then yes
    * the contribution of regret itself is a decreasing one.
* rescuing: (64) I regret that John didn’t come up with something scary.  M;
  regret > not > some
  * _regret_ and _not_ do not cancel out in the standard sense: the sentence
    entails that _John came up with nothing scary_ In that sense, some is not in
    an innocuous positive environment
  * redefining “positive” as “Strawson-increasing”?
  * Given [[something]] > [[something scary]], does (a) Strawson-entail (b)?
    [a] I regret that John didn’t come up with something scary.  [b] I regret
    that John didn’t come up with something.
  * The entailment probably goes through; similarly for _only_ (Only John didn')
  * If so, then if von Fintel’s approach is generally successful and
    * being in a Strawson-increasing environment licenses our PPIs
    * then Jespersen’s proposal extends to the full set of rescuers.
* I will argue, however, that the rescuing phenomenon is not like that
  * other relevant examples that cannot be accounted for in this way
  * The above argument rests on that PPIs are sensitive to the monotonicity
    properties of the full context
    * cancelling = the two decreasing functions are composed into an increasing
  * hE, PPIs are only allergic to clausemate negation
  * if we add a further negation on top of the rescuer and thereby switch the
    polarity of the context, the PPI remains happy: (70) I don’t regret that
    John didn’t come up with something.  √ not > some
  * the above account makes incorrect predictions concerning the range of
    possible rescuers
    * one of the basic facts about the PPIs at hand: they
      * cannot scope immediately below a local antiadditive but they
      * can be in the immediate scope of a merely decreasing local operator.
        (71) ?* No one came up with something.  (72) At most five people came up
        with something.
    * ie while the PPI is OK in an increasing local context, it does not require
      one
    * What if we eliminate the antiadditive property of the local context and
    * if the local context is simply _decreasing_ the PPI will still be rescued?
    * Szabolcsi and Zwarts 1990 observe that given two functions f and g, where
      g is antiadditive, their composition f ° g i.e. λx[f(gx)] is antiadditive
      iff f is multiplicative, viz.  f(a∧b)=fa∧fb
    * e.g.
      * g = Negation: doesn’t walk or talk is equivalent to doesn’t walk and doe
      * f = John is multiplicative: John A and B = John A and John B
      * f = More than two men is not multiplicative: More than two men A and B
        is
        * the composed function _more than two men don’t V_ is just decreasing
    * If extending the context by means of function composition is a possible
      means of rescuing the PPI, then we predict that adding _more than two men_
      above the offending antiadditive rescues the PPI as much as adding an
      NPI-licensor does.
    * This prediction is just wrong: (73) ?* More than two men didn’t come up
      with something.  cannot mean `More than two men came up with nothing’
* In sum: the rescuing effect cannot be due to context extension.

## 5.2 [AA-Op > PPI] is a non-lexical NPI 18

* To reiterate, we have noticed that
  * the illegitimate constellation [AA-Op > PPI], in which a PPI scopes
    immediately below a clausemate antiadditive op is rendered fully acceptable
    if an item that licenses weak (ever-type) NPIs is added scopally immediately
    above it
  * the rescuing effect is nothing but NPI-licensing.
* three similarities between rescuing and NPI-licensing
1. the set of NPI-licensors is not a simple and natural set.
  * the exact same set is relevant in connection with a new phenomenon,
  * it cannot easily be taken to be pure coincidence. While
  * von Fintel argues that Strawson-entailment is a reasonable and useful rel
  * it is probably not the only entailment relation relevant in natural language
  * hard to show that regret, be glad, and others actually lend themselves to
    the Strawson-decreasing analysis
  * ie if Strawson-decreasingness (or some other property uniting weak NPI-lors)
    turns out to be critical in a new domain, that is something to take note of.
2. both is hindered by an intervener. Compare (74), in the spirit of Linebarger
1987, with the PPI-data (75) (74/75) I didn’t expect that John would say
anything/something because this was a public event ( *but because I know how he
is).
3. once an NPI has found its licensor, adding another negative operator above it
does not hurt
  * a non-trivial property since the expanded context is increasing. We have
  * rescuing behaves the same way.  (76) I don’t think that John didn’t come up
    with anything.  (77) I don’t regret that John didn’t come up with something.
* all “distributional” properties of NPI-licensing carry over to the rescuing of
  [AA-Op > PPI]. Thus, the proposed parallelism is this: (78)  Unlicensed NPIs:
  Licensed NPIs: *He saw [anything].           I don’t think he saw [anything].
  *He [didn’t see something].   I don’t think he [didn’t see something].
* [AA-Op > PPI] differs from time-honored NPIs in that it is
  * not a lexical entry and does not denote a minimal amount. This, I suggest,

# 6. PPIs are double NPIs 19

* the relation between AA-Op and the PPI.
* three clues
1. the semantic property the PPI detests [utál] is antiadditivity. As was
  * Zwarts: there is a class of NPIs that require precisely this kind of licer
  * In English, examples are _yet_ and _squat_
    * _squat_ (Horn 2001a and Postal 2000a), a vulgar minimizer.  (79/80/81) I
      haven’t/No one has/`*`At most five people have been here yet.  (82) *I
      regret that you have been here yet (83) He didn’t know squat. can mean `He
      didn’t know anything’ (84) No one knows squat. can mean `No one knows
      anything’ (85) At most five people knew squat. cannot mean `=<5 people
      knew anything’ (86) I regret that he knew squat. cannot mean `I regret
      that he knew anythng’
* As Postal: _squat_ has another use where it means 'nothing’: (87) He knows
  squat.  `He knows nothing’
  * We are not concerned with the latter, it must be carefully ignored.
  * For each vulgar minimizer, some speakers of English have both usages, some
    only one of the two.
* some of the NPIs that need an anti-additive licenser require the licenser to
  be clausemate.
  * In Dutch such are (Marcel den Dikken, p.c.)
    * een hand voor ogen (zien) `(to see) a hand before (one’s) eyes’ and
    * met een vinger (aanraken) ‘(touch) with a finger’
    * not ook maar `even’
* In English squat and, for some speakers, yet need clausemate licensors. This
  * compare didn’t think, where think is an optional neg-raiser, with didn’t
    say, where say is not a neg-raiser:
2. our PPIs fail to scope under a clausemate antiadditive but do not mind an
extraclausal one
* (92) and (93) are acceptable because
  * say is not a neg-raiser and even
  * _think_ is only optionally a neg-raiser
  * i.e. in both cases the negation can be interpreted in the matrix clause:
    (92) I didn’t say that he came up with something.  (93) I didn’t think that
    he came up with something.
3. the licensing of yet and squat, just like that of any, is blocked by an
intervening scopal element, cf. Linebarger 1987: (94) He didn’t (`*`always)
understand squat.
* To summarize, we find an uncanny similarity as regards anti-additivity,
  clausemateness, and intervention:
  * (96) [AA-Op > strong NPI]   licensing, unless blocked by intervener (97)
    [AA-Op > PPI]          violation, unless blocked by intervener
* why does the same constellation constitute licensing/violation in one/other
  * that PPIs have two NPI-features. One is
    * a strong-NPI feature like that of yet and squat: it requires a clausemate
      antiadditive licensor, without intervention. The
    * a weak-NPI feature like that of ever: it requires a Strawson-decreasing
      licensor (not necessarily clausemate but without intervention)
* metaphor for expository purposes. I propose that
  * these two features are normally "dormant"
  * A context that can license the strong-NPI feature "activates" and licenses
    that feature. What we have seen indicates, however,
  * the other, weak-NPI feature gets activated but not licensed.  Therefore, the
    * illegitimate, unless a licensor for the weak-NPI feature is provided.
  * i.e. the satisfaction of this craving for antiadditives activates another,
    which needs to be satisfied independently. Schematically:
* one aspect of the descriptive claim. The essence of the proposal is that
  * our PPIs have a combination of two NPI features. In that sense,23
  * the PPI phenomenon reduces to the NPI phenomenon. Exactly what NPI features
  * the features of someone / something type PPIs match quite closely the
    combined properties of yet and ever, we know that
  * there are many other kinds of NPIs.
  * Even the ones roughly classed together above are not entirely identical,
    e.g. squat seems to care more about the locality of its licensor than yet.
  * It would be equally possible for a PPI to have a combination of two other
    NPI-features
  * the proposal expects exactly the existence of the kind of correspondences
    that emerge from van der Wouden’s work
    * ie whatever property is desired by some NPI may turn out to be detested by
      some PPI and/or to function as a rescuer thereof. Naturally,
  * future more refined versions of this proposal may point out possible and
    impossible combinations. As of date, we know altogether little about why

Part Two: PPIs, NPIs, and negative concord 24

# 7. “Dormant” versus “active” NPI-features: double negation versus resumptive
quantification 24

* The interpretation of an NPI-feature must be a logical operator O such that
  * each occurrence of O is semantically significant (the active need for
    licensing) but
  * two occurrences of O together look as though O is not even there (dormancy).
    There is one and only one logical operator that fits the bill: negation.
* interpret the positive polarity items we are investigating roughly, as
  λP¬¬∃x[person(x) & P(x)]. That is,
  * each NPI-feature is a negation
  * If these negations do not enter into a relation with an NPI-licenser, they
    simply cancel out when the truth conditions of the sentence are calculated
    (dormancy). This is what happens in examples (99)- (99) He saw someone
    person’ ¬¬∃x[person(x) & he_saw(x)] (100) Few boys saw someone few
    x[boy(x)][¬¬∃y[ person(y) & x_saw(y)]] (101) It is not the case that he saw

  * indefinite pronouns that are formed with two negations (see the Oxford Lat)
    (102) a. non nemo `some persons, a few’ b. non nullus `a certain amount of,
    not a little; a number of, not a few; some men’ c. non numquam `on various
    occasions, sometimes’
* The following text shows that non nemo is indeed comparable to someone: 20

    of anaphora are concerned double negations in standard English behave as if

    * Their syntactic formation is known as absorption
  * idea here is to
    * factor out the negative components of the two licensors and to
    * let each form a binary quantifier with the negation corresponding to one
      of the NPI-features. For example: (104) At most five boys didn’t call
      someone `not more than five boys not called not-not-one’ no<x,y>[x(more
      than five) boys no<z,w> [z(called) w (y(one]))]
* by absorbing the licenser negation and the licensee negation into a single
  negative quantifier we effectively eliminate the licensee. Thus,
  * the two negations postulated for PPIs “disappear” both in (99)-(101) and in
    (104), albeit in very different ways. 21
* What kind of binary quantification is at work here? Assuming that
  * each negation is construed as a negative determiner whose restriction is a
    set of individuals or events or degrees,
  * the binary quantifier might be a cumulative, a branching, or a resumptive
  * These three schemata
    * yield identical results when the input quantifiers are both negative,
    * although they may diverge on other inputs (van Benthem 1983, Sher 1990).
* I choose resumptive quantification. As May explains, resumptive quantification
  is
  * the simplest and least controversial
    * nothing beyond binding multiple variables.
  * conveniently predicts the existence of intervention effects, see section 8.2
* The resumptive reading of _No one loves no one_ would be formalized as
  * (105) in May 1989, or as
  * (106) using the generalized quantifier notation of de Swart and Sag 2002:
    (105) A sequence g satisfies NOx,y(x loves y) iff no sequence g’ satisfies x
    loves y, where g’ differs from g in at most the values assigned to x and to
    y (106) HUMAN × HUMAN NO             (LOVE) = ¬∃x∃y[human x, human y][x love
    y] E^2
* Resumptive quantification is so called because it occurs when the phrases
  absorbed have identical determiners, e.g.  (107) Exactly three men read
  exactly three books.  (a) asymmetrical scope: exactly three men each read
  exactly three books (b) resumption: there are exactly three man-book pairs (3
  books were read)
* My use of resumptive quantification = the phrases absorbed have identical
  semantic interpretation.
* To summarize: a semantics for NPI-features, licensing, and dormancy Although
  some novel assumptions are made, the mechanisms appealed to have

# 8. Negative polarity and negative concord: Postal meets de Swart and Sag 27

## 8.1 NPI licensing: the basic idea

* what are NPI
  * Traditionally: expressions that are unacceptable unless they occur in a
    licensing envr
  * Postal 2000a,b
    * certain expressions come with (semantically significant) underlying
      negations and map onto various surface morphologies depending on whether
      those negations stay in place or are removed (preserving meaning)
    * eg take an underlying representation that involves ¬∃. This may
    * surface as
      * no one if the negation stays in place (I saw no one).  Alternatively, it
      * anyone if the negation
        * raises out (I didn’t see anyone) or gets
          * not be relevant to us and I will ignore it from now on.
        * deleted (No one saw anyone).
* the appropriate deleter of the ¬ of ¬∃ is a local anti-additive.
  * Deviations from this prototypical situation may occur in the cases of
    lexical gaps: eg yet spells out ¬∃ under raising/deletion, but it does not
    have a negation-retaining morphological counterpart.  One extremely
    interesting
* this proposal does
  * not rely on mechanisms that filter completed structures for well-formedness.
  * morphemes any, yet, ever, etc.  appear only where the given underlying
    representations are legitimately mapped to them. Thus the system conforms to
  * failure proof, which has always been at the heart of lexicalist theories
    like HPSG and categorial grammar and is advocated in Chomsky 2001. 25 Prior
    to proceeding further with details, let
* what is to be meant by deletion
  * Postal has a fully morphosyntactic mechanism in mind. In contrast,
  * I envisage a semantic mechanism with stipulated morphological reflexes. In
    * identify NPI-licensing with the absorption of the licenser negation and
      the pertinent negative component of the NPI into a binary resumptive quant
      (108) `no<x,y> [ [ licenser ... x ....] ... [ NPI ....y ...] ]`
  * assimilate Postal’s proposal to standard feature checking. It is generally
  * in minimalist theory, features come in interpretable--uninterpretable pairs;
    one is carried by a head and the other by an XP
    * Feature checking is effected when the two enter into a specifier--head
      relation and the uninterpretable member of the pair is deleted
  * In the present case, both negations are semantically significant, therefore
    feature checking is effected by binary resumption

## 8.2 Intervention effects 29

* resumptive quantification will explain why scopal interveners eg _always_
  block NPI-licensing and shield PPIs, e.g., (109) a. * I didn’t always say
  anything.  b. I didn’t always say something.
* Developing de Swart’s 1992 proposal for intervention effects in split
  constructions (see (110)),
  * Honcoop 1998: intervention effects = cases where an operator is separated
    from its restriction by a scopal elem,
    * Dynamic Semantics to explain why this is bad.  (110) `*`Combien  as-tu
      beaucoup conduit __ de camions?  how-many have-you a lot    driven     of
      trucks
* that resumptive quantification factors out the shared operator of two or more
  operator--restriction units.  (In Pesetsky’s 2000 terms, it might be a case of
  feature movement.)
* Without the intervener, _I didn’t say anything_ might be represented as below,
  variable-binding          no<x,y>[at event (y) I say thing(x)] generalized
  quantifier    no[event,thing][said-by-me-at]
* _Always_ in (109) will separate the operator no at least from the
  thing-portion of its binary restriction. In this way,
* the present proposal naturally predicts the sensitivity of NPI-licensing to
  Linebarger’s 1987 intervention effects.
* Honcoop 1998 sought to subsume the intervention effects in NPI-licensing under
  his general theory, but he did so with reference to the mechanics of the
  computation of scalar implicatures. I
  * the present proposal extends to the cases where no scalar implicatures

## 8.3 Negative concord 30

* de Swart and Sag 2002 exploit the ability of two negations to either cancel
  out or to undergo resumption to account for the ambiguity of (112) (112)
  Personne n' aime personne.  no one loves no one !\exitst a !\exitst b a love b
  (everyone loves someone, double neg read) !\exitst a,b a love b
  (negative concord reading, resumption)
* They implement absorption with the aid of Cooper-storage
  * Quantifier meanings are introduced when the quantifiers enter the syntax but
    are stored away and retrieved at an appropriate later point
  * Since absorption requires semantic constituents that are orthogonal to the
    usual syntactic ones, Cooper-storage indeed seems like appropriate
  * De Swart and Sag also generalize resumption
    * standard res involves only clausemate quantifiers, to
    * gen res covers cases like the following: (113) Je n’exige qu’ils arrêtent
      personne.  'I don’t demand követel that they arrest anyone’
* I tentively adopt de Swart and Sag' s 2002 theory
* Treating negative polarity and negative concord with the same semantic device
  seems quite natural. After all, they are variations on the same meaning.
* Resumption will play a role in the proposed grammar in both its binary and its
  arbitrarily n-ary versions
  * Licensing is always binary resumption
  * negative concord may involve an arbitrary number of negative quantifiers;
    * likewise, the same licensor may license an arbitrary number of NPIs that
      do not c-command each other, e.g.: (114) No one talked with any man but
      Bill about any woman but Susan on any day but Sunday
* I assume that the any-phrases in (114) are first absorbed into a ternary
  quantifier (form one big NPI), which then establishes its relation with the
  licensor no one in a single step of binary resumption
  * In contrast, negative concord is effected in a single n-ary step (a big
    negative quantifier is formed), as in de Swart and Sag, and
    * no licensing step is involved

## 8.4 Interim summary 31

* the semantics that my PPI proposal entails for standard NPIs is viable.
  * It squares with Postal's conclusion that NPIs contain silent negations

* needed
  10. an account of the full distribution of PPIs
  9. introducing some further crucial aspects of Postal's proposal

# 9. Postal on _any_ and _no_ 32

* two issues
  * the underlying representations and
  * the patterns emerging from mapping to surface morphology.
* This section retains Postal’s deletion terminology.
* The standard assumption is that any is an existential and no is a negative det
  (in those dialects of English that do not have negative concord). But
* Postal 2000a argues that both are ambiguous between a negative and an existial
* evidence comes from
  * the subspecies of exceptives which is thought to attach to pos or neg univls
    * see the discussion in footnote 25. Postal 2000a,b notices that
    * both _any_ and _no_ can host but-exceptives in some contexts but not in
      othr (115) No one said anything but hello.  (116) `*`At most five people
      said anything but hello.  (117) I said nothing but hello.  (118) `*`I
      didn’t say NOthing but hello.
    * (118) is to be compared with the OK double negation reading in (119);
    * the pragmatically and intonationally distinct denial reading will be
      discussed in connection with (129) (119) I didn’t say NOthing (although I
      didn’t say much).  `I said something’
  * those instances of any and no that can be modified by exceptives can undergo
    negative fronting, e.g.  (120) a. I didn’t think that any gorilla (but Kong)
    would they try to train.  b. * At most five people think that any gorilla
    would they try to trai
* the negative and the existential version occur in different contexts
* the underlying representation of those instances of no and any that can host
  exceptives involves ¬∃, which is equivalent to a negative universal (∀¬), as
  desired.
  * morphology may spell it out in more than one way
  * If the negation
    * stays in place, the det is spelled out as no, eg I saw no one (but Bill).
    * raised out or is deleted by an appropriate deleter, the determiner is
      spelled out as any, as in No one saw anyone (but Bill).
      * To account for the contrast in (115)-(116) the deleter of this
        underlying negation must be a local anti-additive operator.
* those any/no-phrases that do not host exceptives and are therefore diagnosed
  as underlying existentials
  * Postal assumes that these in fact involve two negations, ¬¬∃.
    * In the interest of a unitary mechanism that maps underlying
      representations to morphology
  * not affect the semantics while being instrumental in getting the morphology
  * The two negations are dealt with in two separate steps. The
    * lower negation gets deleted by the higher one.  The
    * higher one may either stay in place or get deleted by an external deleter,
      which in this case may be any Strawson-decreasing operator. In other
  * the quantifier will end up with either one negative or none. Now the same
  * one ¬ left in place spells no, no ¬ left in place spells any.
* It is straightforward to identify the single negation in Postal’s ¬∃ with the
  lower negation in his ¬¬∃: the former is said to require a local anti-additive
  deleter and the latter always turns out to be deleted by one (the higher
  negation in the same DP)

# 10. Placing PPIs into context 33

* Postal’s system as outlined above is the periodic table of elements: when the
  known elements are arranged in their proper places, the existence of further,
  hitherto unknown elements is predicted. I claim that
* the PPIs described previously fill gaps in the system. One advantage of
* certain pecul of the PPI’s distribution will now require no spec stipulation

## 10.1 The some—any—no paradigm for ¬¬∃ 34

* in section 6 I concluded that PPIs have two NPI-features:
  * one that requires a local antiadditive licensor and
  * another that is happy with any old Strawson-decreasing one. I noted that
* these features may remain “dormant” or get licensed individually.
* In section 7 I proposed that these features be interpreted as negations which
  either cancel out (dormancy) or enter into two separate resumptive
  quantifications. This
  * makes sense if NPI-licensing is in general interpreted using resumptive
    quantification, and in section 8 I proposed to make that move.
* In section 9 I summarized some aspects of Postal’s work which, entirely
  independently, had concluded that
  those any-forms and no-forms that receive an existential interpretation have
  two underlying negations that may get deleted on the way to surface morphology.
* I am now proposing that
  the some-forms I am investigating are just another way of spelling out an
  underlying ¬¬∃
  * I intend a parallel claim to hold of all PPIs that have the same
    distribution as these some-forms.
* Disjunctions in Hungarian and several other languages are one case in point,
  * demonstrated in detail in Szabolcsi 2002; they will be interpreted as
  λpλq¬¬(p∨q)
* Some—any—no just constitute a particularly nice paradigm: no accidental gaps.
* _would rather_ may be regarded as elements of a paradigm that has accidental
  gaps in both the “no-slot” and in the “any-slot”.
* the two negations that Postal postulates
  can be identified with the two NPI-features
  * One of Postal’s negs wants a local anti-additive deleter, like one of mine
  * The other negation in Postal’s existentials is happy with any
    Strawson-decreasing deleter – just like the other NPI-feature in PPIs.
* consider the logical possibilities of Postal’s system
* I will use the neutral term “license”, which
  for Postal means deletion and
  in my terms, the formation of a resumptive quantifier.
  (121) Spelling out underlying ¬¬∃:
    a.  one ¬ licensed DP-internally, NO    (I didn’t say NOthing)
        other ¬ stays in place
    b.  one ¬ licensed DP-internally, any   (I didn’t say anything)
        other ¬ externally
    c.  both ¬’s stay in place        some  (I said something, etc.)
    d.  both ¬’s licensed externally  some  (Few people didn’t say something)
* The one change c and d requires is a slight modification of the spell-out rule
  that covers both ¬∃ and ¬¬∃
  * If two negations are left in place, spell some
  * If one negation is left in place, spell no
  * where no negation is left in place
    * If two negations are licensed by DP-external licensers, spell some;
    * elsewhere spell any
* The elsewhere case comprises situations where there was/were
  * just one negation and it got removed as well as situations where there were
  * two and one was licensed DP-internally and the other externally.
* In a negative concord language the mapping algorithm must be extended to cater
  to n-words surfacing under resumption

## 10.2 Deriving the “activation” data 36

* how placement into this context benefits the analysis of PPIs,
  over and above supporting the postulation of “invisible negations”. One
* a local anti-additive operator “activates” both NPI-features but licenses only
  one (hence the need for a Strawson-decreasing rescuer). Thus, to safely
* why the following possibilities to derive
  `*`No one said something or
  `*`He didn’t say something do not arise:
(122) a.  `*`AA-Op licenses one NPI-feature of the PPI; the other is left in plc
      b. `*`The same AA-Op licenses both NPI-features of the PPI.
      c. `*`Both NPI-features of the PPI are left in place
            in the context of AA-Op.
* (122a) immediately follows from the spell-out rule. If one negation is
  licensed by the anti-additive and, crucially, the other is left in place, the
  determiner is spelled out as no, not as some. The second possibility would be
  for the same anti-additive operator to license both NPI- features of
  something, cf. (122b). If licensing itself is by definition a one-to-one
  relation between a licensor and a licensee (a binary operation), then this is
  possible if only the two NPI-features are first absorbed into a single NPI.
  Given our semantics, this case will be indistinguishable from (121b), where
  one of the NPI-features was licensed DP-internally by the other, the latter
  being licensed DP-externally. But in this constellation the spell-out rule
  chooses any, not some.
* In connection with (122c), recall that there are several cases where both
  negations are left in place: _I said something, I don’t think that he said
  something, and Few people said something_.  (That merely decreasing few does
  not set off the activation process is due to the fact that the negation
  corresponding to the strong-NPI feature intervenes between it and the weak-NPI
  feature it might license.) Why is the same not possible in the presence of a
  local anti-additive operator, i.e. why cannot `*`No one said something arise in
  that way?

To pave the way to answering this question, notice the unacceptability of (123),
in contrast to (124):
(123) `*`No one didn’t laugh.
[unless denial]
(124) Few people didn’t laugh.

This is a new fact and it is not accounted for yet. Likewise, let us go back to Postal’s observation
that _No one said NOthing is acceptable_ on the double negation reading with appropriate
intonation (fall-rise contour on the second no) but the lower negative cannot host an exceptive.

The same holds for I didn’t say NOthing:
(125) No one said NOthing
'Everyone said SOMEthing’
(126) csNo one said NOthing but hello.
(126) indicates that the direct object in (125) has ¬¬∃. But nothing in the system prevents
another analysis for the strings No one said nothing, where the direct object has ¬∃ and no
licensing takes place, as in (129).
(127) no-one V ¬∃ => ¬∃ is spelled out as no

Given that this analysis has ¬∃, the nothing so obtained is predicted to host an exceptive. The
fact that this prediction is incorrect indicates that (127) should be excluded. To facilitate the
correct formulation of the generalization, notice that the denial readings of the problematic
sentences (with stress on the first negative) may in fact be acceptable:
√ as a denial of Someone said nothing but hello
(128) NO one said nothing but hello.
(125)-(126) differ from (128) in their intonation contour and discourse properties; the former
have the characteristics of contrastive topicalization, the latter those of denial.

Taking denial into account, a generalization can be formulated as follows:
(129) Resume [AA-Op > strong-NPI feature]:

When a strong-NPI feature occurs in the immediate scope of a local antiadditive, it
cannot remain unlicensed (unless the antiadditive expresses denial). Resumption is
obligatory in this configuration.
(129) rules out the structures (127), where the strong NPI feature that remains unlicensed is
embodied in ¬∃. It also rules out (123), *No one didn’t laugh, if overt preverbal negation is
subsumed under “strong-NPI feature”. But, crucial to the central concern of this paper, (129)
certainly subsumes the classical PPI facts:
(130) No one said something * not>some, unless denial
(131) I didn’t say something. * not>some, unless denial

Recall that in the present setup, these unacceptable sentences might arise when both NPI-features
of someone remain “dormant” (unlicensed). (129) rules this out with reference to the fact that
one of these features is a strong-NPI feature in the context of a local antiadditive.

Invoking (129) does not amount to replacing the traditional prohibition (PPIs cannot
scope under a local anti-additive) with another prohibition of the same sort
  * First, recall that the analysis of PPIs as double NPIs serves to explain the
    phenomenon of rescuing, which the traditional prohibition has nothing to say
    about
  * Second, (129) makes the PPI-restriction just a special case of a more
    general phenomenon, namely, a bias against double negatives and a preference
    for negative polarity licensing or negative concord (whichever the given
    language makes available). The reason why the two NPI-features of a PPI
    cannot remain “dormant” in the
context of a local antiadditive is the same as the reason why *No one didn’t laugh and *I didn’t
say nothing (but hello) are unacceptable on the double negation reading. And since the ability to
generalize over these cases is contingent on positing “invisible negations” for PPIs, the
generalization, if correct, supports this implementation of the observations made in Part One.

* A. Giannakidou (p.c.): double negation readings are cross-linguistically much
  less generally available than de Swart and Sag 2002 might lead one to expect.
  (129) predicts that double negation is possible when the lower of the two
  negations embodies a weak-NPI feature -- as is the case with someone, as
  discussed in fn. 32. It may well be that the cross-linguistic variation can be
  captured along these lines. Pursuing these connections must be left to further
  research, however.

# 11. Is polarity sensitivity grounded in scalar or referential lexical sem? 39

* both Postal’s proposal and mine are devoid of scalar semantic insight. Defic?
* This paper has argued that certain expressions are endowed with
  “NPI-features”, embodied by negations in their lexical semantics.
  * NPI-hood and PPI-hood are not shown to follow from other lexical semantic
    properties of these items.
  * question arises whether this agnostic position misses some empirical generaliz
  * two candidates:
* grounding NPI-hood in scalarity and PPI-hood in referentiality.
* NPIs (Kadmon and Landman 1993, Lahiri 1997, Krifka 1992, 1995)
  * extend the domain of quantification and are subject to a strengthening
    requirement, or that
  * being focussed minimal amount expressions,
    they give rise to contradictory scalar implicatures
    unless they are in an implication reversing context
  * different NPIs require different kinds of licensors has not received a
    comparable explanation, which is disturbing. In any case,
* Hoeksema (p.c.) observes that various standard NPIs, such as
  * eg _much_, _in ages_, _either_, and _all that [adj]_ are not minimizers, and
  * Chierchia 2001: the properties from which the above mentioned theories
    derive NPI-hood characterize only some, but not all, NPIs. Chierchia himself
    revises of Kadmon and Landman’s theory to the effect that widening cum
    strengthening is possible but not obligatory. Even this may be too much to
    ask, however.
* Recall that structures like [didn’t see something] have been shown to be NPIs
  in the sense that they have exactly the same distribution as classical NPIs,
  * how they might fit Chierchia’s recipee.  Furthermore, it has been argued
  * minute details of licensing determine whether the same truth conditional
    content gets spelled out as any, no, or some (see (120)).
* Next, consider PPIs
  * A. Giannakidou (p.c.) suggests that PPI-hood might be derived from the
    referentiality of some-phrases, specifically, that
    somePs always assert existence in some model. Details notwithstanding, the
  * question: whether such an explanation naturally extends to all PPIs. Some
  * difficulties already in English
    * _somewhat_ and _to some extent_ and objects of verbs of creation (see
      (54)-(56)) are not referential in the way _someone I know, a certain
      person_, etc. are. Then there are expressions like
    * eg _would rather_ that are rescuable PPIs but no referential semantics in
  * cross-linguistic variation in the inventory of PPIs. As pointed out in
    * Hungarian disjunctions with medial vagy 'or’ exhibit
      the same PPI properties that Hungarian valaki 'someone’ and valami
    * _valaki/mi_ behave like their English counterparts; see Szabolcsi 2002 for
    * Similar in Russian, Serbo-Croatian, and many other languages,
      whereas disjunctions are not PPIs for example in English, Romanian,
      Bulgarian, and Modern Greek. It seems to me that a lexical semantic
      explanation of why someone is a PPI is
plausible only if it also correctly predicts that Hungarian vagy is a PPI but English or is not. So
maybe Hungarian vagy is a “referential disjunction” like someone I know, and English or is a
“preferably non-specific disjunction” like a person? This is a very interesting possibility but as
* Hungarian vagy clearly prefers narrow scope with respect to even a
  c-commanding clausemate quantifier and does not like to take extra-wide scope
  – I would say “wide scope vagy” is even more difficult than English “wide
  scope or” is according to Rooth and Partee 1982. “Wide scope vagy” can be
  forced by adding “but I don’t know which”. However, in this case the addition
  creates, rather than highlights, an interpretive option, because it carries a
  presupposition that needs to be globally accommodated
  * sum: no immediate evidence for Hungarian vagy being comparable to English
    referential indefinites. But then referentiality cannot be the key.
