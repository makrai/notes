# Abs

We empirically compare 
  two-dimensional principal component analysis, the parallel factor model and
  the Tucker decomposition with PCA in terms of the reconstruction errors

# Intro

* varied tensor-based dimension reduction methods [2, 3, 4] have been recently
  proposed and achieved better performances than PCA in face recognition
* parallel factor model (Parafac) [6, 5] and the Tucker decomposition [7, 5]
  are two major tensor decomposition methods
