PCA vs. Tensor-Based Dimension Reduction Methods:
  An Empirical Comparison on Active Shape Models of Organs
Jiun-Hung Chen and Linda G. Shapiro

# Abs

We empirically compare ~ with PCA in terms of the reconstruction errors
  * two-dimensional principal component analysis
  * parallel factor model and 
  * Tucker decomposition 

# Intro

* varied tensor-based dimension reduction methods [2, 3, 4] have been recently
  proposed and achieved better performances than PCA in face recognition
* parallel factor model (Parafac) [6, 5] and the Tucker decomposition [7, 5]
  are two major tensor decomposition methods
