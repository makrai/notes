# Abstract

* Recent work [learns] cross-lingual word embeddings
  without parallel data … through adversarial training
  evaluation [uses] comparable corpora or closely-related languages
* This work
  * fully unsupervised initialization that explicitly
    exploits the structural similarity of the embeddings, and a robust
  * self-learning algorithm that iteratively improves this solution. Our method
  * surpassing previous supervised systems. Our
* implementation is released as an open source project
