# Intro

pioneering work have attempted to integrate word sense disambiguation into
various compositional models for semantic capture [24], [25], [26], [27],
[28].  In these multi-sense word embeddings based compositional semantic
models, two operations are performed before the semantic composition: one is to
learn multi-sense embeddings and another is to disambiguate the word sense.
These two parts are complex and challenging, and are usually conducted
separately.
