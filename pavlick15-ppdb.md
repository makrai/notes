  word embeddings, and style classification 
E Pavlick, P Rastogi, J Ganitkevitch, Benjamin Van Durme, Chris Callison-Burch
ACL 15

# 3 Other Additions

* entailment relation from Pavlick et al. (2015)
* style classifications from Pavlick and Nenkova (2015)
* and associated vector embedding from Rastogi et al. (2015)

## Style scores

* two dimensions– complexity and formality. Table 2 shows some paraphrases of
  the end, sorted from most complex to most simple using these scores. These
  * could be useful for natural language generation tasks like 
    text simplification (Xu et al., 2015). 
  * evaluation of these scores is given in Pavlick and Nenkova (2015)
