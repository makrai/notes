A Spreading-Activation Theory of Retrieval in Sentence Production
Gary S. Dell
Psychological Review 1986, Vol. 93, No. 3,283-321

# Abstract

* a theory of sentence production that accounts for facts about speech errors
  * the kinds of errors that occur, the constraints on their form, and the
    conditions that precipitate them
* The theory combines a spreading-activation retrieval mechanism with
  assumptions regarding linguistic units and rules
* Two simulation models are presented to illustrate how the theory applies to
  phonological encoding processes
  1. designed to produce the basic kinds of phonological errors and their
     relative frequencies of occurrence
  2. to fit data from an experimental technique designed to create these errors
     under controlled conditions

# 1 Intro

* Psycholinguistics is concerned with three basic and interrelated aspects of
  * acquisition, or how language is learned
  * comprehension, or how sentences are understood
  * production, or how sentences are spoken. Of these three, production has been
    * the least studied and is probably the least understood
* Recent research denned problems that are unique production. For example
  * how thought, which often lacks a temporal structure, is translated via
    syntactic rules into temporally ordered speech
    (Bock, 1982; Kempen, 1978; Lapointe, 1985; Levelt, 1982; MacKay, 1982), or
  * editing (e.g., Levelt, 1983; Motley, Camden, & Baars, 1982), or that of
  * how production fits into a general theory of action
    (Fowler, Rubin, Remez, & Turvey, 1980; Norman, 1981). At the same time
* new methodologies for studying production
  * controlled experiments, as well as through naturalistic observation
    (Bock, 1983; Cooper & Paccia-Cooper, 1980; Fromkin, 1980;
    Sternberg, Monsell, Knoll, & Wright, 1978)
* This article presents a new theory of production
  * current theories have not been developed to the point that 
    * a large number of precise quantitative predictions can be made and tested
    * data can be fitted to models
  * The theory presented here is a step toward reaching this goal
* During production, words must be selected and ordered: syntactic encoding
* I will focus on phonological encoding, and particularly the retrieval
  * because phonology is the most tractable. The units and rules of phonology
* The theory combines assumptions from
  * linguistic theory regarding the units and structures of language with
  * a precisely specified retrieval mechanism based on spreading activation
* the theory falls into a general class of theories that includes
  * interactive activation models (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981;
    Rumelhart & McClelland, 1982; Stemberger, 1982a)
  * connectionist models (Cottrell & Small, 1983; Feldman & Ballard, 1982;
    Grossberg, 1982; Grossberg & Stone, 1986)
  * other spreading activation theories
    (Anderson, 1976, 1983; Dosher, 1982; Rumelhart & Norman, 1982)
    * Anderson, J. R. (1976). Language, memory, and thought. Hillsdale, NJ
* these kinds of theories
  * have their critics (e.g., Ratcliff & Mc-Koon, 1981),
  * beginning to form a theoretical paradigm in cognitive psychology
* ancestors of the theory are
  * spreading-activation production models that postulate
    a network of linguistic rules and units in which decisions about what unit
    or rule to choose are based on the activation levels of the nodes
    representing those rules or units
    (Bock, 1982;Crompton, 1981; Dell & Reich, 1977, 1980, 1981; MacKay, 1982;
    Roche-Lecours & L'hermitte, 1969; Stemberger, 1982a). Another important
  * frame-and-slot models of production, in which it is proposed that
    internal representations of utterances-to-bespoken are constructed by
    inserting linguistic items into slots in independently created structures
    that define the order of the slots
    (Garrett, 1975; MacKay, 1972; Reich, 1977; ShattuckHufnagel, 1979)
* data to be accounted for by the theory are facts about speech errors, or slips
  * often called lapses, Spoonerisms, or Freudian slips, have long been cited as
  * Freud (1901/1958) argued that slips, in addition to revealing unconscious
    motives, may provide "insight into the probable laws of the formation
  * Meringer and Mayer (1895) hoped to discover the mental mechanism
  * Fromkin (1973) remarked that speech error data provide the laboratory data
  * inner workings of a highly complex system are often revealed by the way in
    which the system breaks down
* The theory presented here specifies the kinds of breakdowns that are likely to
  occur, the constraints on the form of slips, and the conditions that pre-
  cipitate them. In addition, the theory will deal with the tendency for
  errors to create meaningful combinations of items, the tendency for similar
  items in similar environments to slip with one another, and the influence of
  changes in the speaking rate on errors

# 1 Basic facts about speech errors and the methodology associated

# 2 Theory of syntactic, morphological, and phonological encoding

# 3 The formal theory for phonological encoding

* A simulation model of the retrieval and ordering of speech sounds is presented
* a model of a particular experimental paradigm for generating phonological
  slips is developed and used to fit data from a comprehensive experiment using

# 4 How the model can be extended to morphological and synt enc 32

* representations at all levels are built in much the same way
  * Generative rules define a sequence of categorically defined slots,
    which are then filled by items that have been retrieved by
    spreading activation through a lexical network
  * Each slot is filled by selecting that item of the appropriate category with
    the highest level of activation
  * The resulting representation is an ordered set of selected items
  * This set was imagined to be a collection of order tags attached to nodes in
    the network that represent the selected items
* three preliminary issues,

## the hypothesized separation between syntactic and morphological processes in

## how rules are guided as they build syntactic and morphological frames, and

## interactive nature of lexical processes in the theory 35

* bottom-up as well as the top-down connections in the network:
  lexical retrieval is highly interactive
* The co-occurrence of top-down and bottom-up processes in the lexicon has often
  been discussed in word recognition (Tanenhaus & Lucas, in press), and
* this section discusses how these processes influence lexical selection
* Consider the syntactic encoding of the sentence _I'm writing a letter to my
  mother_. Let us assume that the syntactic frame has been constructed and word
  nodes have been selected for everything before letter. At this point the
  syntax is seeking to fill the noun slot for the direct object of the sentence
  The conceptual nodes in the semantic representation that stand for the concept
  of letter should be highly activated. Following Bock (1982), we can assume
  that they became activated as a result of some signaling between the syntax
  and the thematic roles that concepts were bound to in the semantic
  representation and that these concepts have been sending activation to word
  nodes connected to them. Normally, the word _letter_ will be the most
  activated noun and it will be selected
* Other nouns will be active as well.  These fall into four broad classes:
  * nouns with some semantic or pragmatic relation with letter—partial synonyms
    (note) or other relations (stamp, envelope),
  * nouns from other parts of the intended utterance (mother) and words related
    to them (father),
  * nouns representing the extralinguistic environment
    (If a dog walks into the room, dog might be active), and
  * nouns that are phonologically related to letter or other highly activated
    words (lettuce, litter)
* Why are all of these words active?
  * first two classes: because their concepts are part of the semantic
    representation of the utterance, and so their activation comes about from
    downward spreading
  * words related to the environment.  The relevant concepts are active to the
    extent that the speaker is attending to these parts of the environment
  * Phonologically similar words are active because of feedback from common
    phonological nodes
* error could be subcategorized on the basis of the relation
  * semantic, environmental, or phonological in nature
  * If another word from the intended utterance, such as mother, replaces
    letter, the error is a misordering—in this case either a simple
* Another fairly common word-level slip is the blend letter/ note — lote
* In this way the theory can
  * give an informal account of word substitutions, misorderings, and blends,
  * allows for a number of possible relations between target and substituting
* The real interest: predictions regarding multiple relations
* e.g.  saying _Let's stop_ for _Let's start_
* The theory's stress on multiple relations places it in conflict with an
  important feature of the standard view of lexical selection,
  * which I have called the two-step theory (Dell & Reich, 1981)
  * advocated by Fromkin (1971) and Fay and Cutler (1977),
  * the main lexicon is ordered such that similar sounding words of the same
    syntactic category are near to each other. Associated with each word is an
    address specifying where the main entry of each word is to be found in the
    * the addresses of phonologically similar words would be very close
  * first step: from a semantic specification to an address, and the
    * Semantic word substitutions (letter —> envelope) happen in this step,
  * second, of going from the address to the word's phonological form
    * phonological word substitutions (letter-•> lettuce), in the second step
* error is caused either in the mapping from meaning to address
  or in the mapping from address to word, but not in both
  * semantic and phonological word substitutions are disjoint sets
  * semantic and phonological factors cannot act together to create substit
* present theory, which allows for feedback from sound to word nodes, claims:
  * phonological relations should sometimes be present in clearly semantic errs
* data supports the existence of multiple relations:
  Butterworth (1981), Harley (1984), and Dell and Reich (1981) have all found
