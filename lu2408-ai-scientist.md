# 1 Intro

* The modern scientific method (Chalmers, 2013; Dewey, 1910; Jevons, 1877) is
  arguably one of the greatest achievements of the Enlightenment.
  * collects background knowledge, drafts a set of plausible hypotheses to
    test, constructs an evaluation procedure, collects evidence for the
    different hypotheses, and finally assesses and communicates their findings.
  * the manuscript undergoes peer review and subsequent iters of refinement
  * This procedure has led to countless breakthroughs in science and
    technology, improving human quality of life.
* automate general scientific discovery (Langley, 1987, 2024; Waltz and
  Buchanan, 2009) has been a long ambition of the community since at least the
  * the Automated Mathematician (Lenat, 1977; Lenat and Brown, 1984) and
    DENDRAL (Buchanan and Feigenbaum, 1981). In the field of AI, researchers
    have envisioned the possibility of 
  * automating AI research using AI itself (Ghahramani, 2015; Schmidhuber,
    1991, 2010a,b, 2012), leading to “AI-generating algorithms” (Clune, 2019).
  * foundation models have seen tremendous advances in their general
    capabilities (Anthropic, 2024; Google DeepMind Gemini Team, 2023; Llama
    Team, 2024; OpenAI, 2023), but they have only been shown to accelerate
  * writing of scientific manuscripts (Altmäe+ 2023; Dinu+ 2024; Ifargan+ 2024;
    Majumder+ 2024), as 
  * a muse to brainstorm ideas (Baek+ 2024; Girotra+ 2023; Wang+ 2024b), or
  * aides to coding (Gauthier, 2024). To date, the community has yet to show

    * hyperparameter and architecture search (He+ 2021; Hutter+ 2019; Lu+
      2022b; Wan+ 2021, 2022) or 
    * algorithm discovery (Alet+ 2020; Chen+ 2024b; Kirsch+ 2019; Lange+
      2023a,b; Lu+ 2022a; Metz+ 2022) within a hand-crafted search space.
    * LLMs extended the search space to more generalized, code-level solutions
      (Faldor+ 2024; Lehman+ 2022; Lu+ 2024a; Ma+ 2023).

    iterations, manuscript writing, and peer reviewing to

    discoveries to improve the next generation of ideas.

## LLMs for Machine Learning Research. 

* Most closely related to our work: those that use LLMs to assist ML research
  * Huang+ (2024) propose a benchmark for measuring how successfully LLMs can
    write code to solve a variety of machine learning tasks
  * Lu+ (2024a) use LLMs to propose, implement, and evaluate new SOTA algos for
    preference optimization.
  * Liang+ (2024) use LLMs to provide feedback on research papers and find that
    they provide similar feedback to human reviewers, while 
  * Girotra+ (2023) find that LLMs can consistently produce higher quality
    ideas for innovation than humans. 
  * Baek+ (2024); Wang+ (2024b) use LLMs to propose research ideas based on
    scientific literature search but do not execute them. 
  * Wang+ (2024c) automatically writes surveys <~ extensive literature search .

## LLMs for Structured Exploration
* LLMs are commonly used as a tool to explore large search spaces. For example,
  * Because LLMs contain many human-relevant priors, they

  * reward functions (Ma+ 2023; Yu+ 2023)
  * virtual robotic design (Lehman+ 2023)
  * environment design (Faldor+ 2024)
  * neural architecture search (Chen+ 2024a). 
* LLMs as 
  * evaluators (Zheng+ 2024) for “interestingness” (Lu+ 2024b; Zhang+ 2024) and
  * recombination operators for 
    * black-box optimization with Evolution Strategies (Lange+ 2024; Song+
      2024) and for 
    * Quality-Diversity approaches (Bradley+ 2024; Ding+ 2024; Lim+ 2024). Our
      * many proposed ideas are new combinations of previous ones

## Limitations of the Automated Reviewer. While the automated reviewer shows

* ICLR 2022 is old enough to potentially appear in the base model pre-training
  * nL LLMs were far from being able to reproduce old reviews exactly from
    initial segments, which suggests they have not memorized this data.
  * the rejected papers in our dataset used the original submission file,
    whereas for the accepted papers only the final camera-ready copies were
  * Future iterations could use more recent submissions (e.g. from TMLR) for
  * the automated reviewer is unable to ask questions to the authors in a
  * unable to view figures and must rely on textual descriptions of them.

## Common Failure Modes

* The AIScientist's some shortcomings already identified in Section 5. These

    different runs and even models
    * possible solutions
      * directly follow up and go deeper on its best ideas, or by 
      * recently-published papers as a source of novelty.
  * Tabs 3-5: Aider fails to implement a significant fraction of the ideas.
    * GPT-4o in particular frequently fails to write LaTeX that compiles. While
  * The AIScientist may incorrectly implement an idea, which can be difficult
    * possible partial solution:  An adversarial code-checking reviewer may

  * limited number of experiments per idea, the ~> results often do not meet
    the expected rigor and depth of a standard ML
    * no fair experiments that control for the number of parameters, FLOPs, or
      runtime. This often leads to deceptive or inaccurate conclusions. We
    * these issues will be mitigated as the cost of compute continues to drop.
  * we do not currently use the vision capabilities of foundation models, it is
    ~> visual issues with the paper or read plots. For example, 
    * the generated plots are sometimes unreadable, tables sometimes exceed the
      width of the page, and the page layout (including the overall visual
      appearance of the paper (Huang, 2018)) is often suboptimal. 
    * Future versions with vision and other modalities should fix this.
  * sometimes struggles to find and cite the most relevant papers. It also
    * commonly fails to correctly reference figures in LaTeX, and sometimes
      even hallucinates invalid file paths.

      take this into account when comparing it to the baseline. To partially
    * nL we make sure all experimental results are reproducible, storing copies
      of all files when they are executed.
  * Rarely, it hallucinates entire results. For example, 
    * eg an early version of our writing prompt told it to always include
      confidence intervals and ablation studies. Due to 
    * computational constraints ~> The AIScientist did not always collect
      additional results ~>
    * sometimes hallucinate an entire ablations table. 
    * We resolved this by instructing The AIScientist explicitly to only
      include results it directly observed.
    * it frequently hallucinates facts we do not provide, eg the hardware used.
  * More generally, we do not recommend taking the scientific content of this
    version of The AIScientist at face value. 
    * Instead, hints of promising ideas for practitioners to follow up on.
      Nonetheless, we expect its trustworthiness to increase dramatically in
    * we hint at what is likely to be possible soon.

## Safe Code Execution

* there is minimal direct sandboxing in the code, leading to several unexpected
  and sometimes undesirable outcomes if not appropriately guarded against. For
* eg
  * The AIScientist wrote code in the experiment file that initiated a system
    call to relaunch itself, causing an uncontrolled increase in Python
    processes and eventually necessitating manual intervention. In another run,
  * The AIScientist edited the code to save a checkpoint for every update step,
    which took up nearly a terabyte of storage. 
  * In some cases, when The AI Scientist’s experiments exceeded our imposed
    time limits, it attempted to edit the code to extend the time limit
    arbitrarily instead of trying to shorten the runtime. While creative, the
* potential implications for AI safety (Lehman+ 2020). Moreover, The
* occasionally imported unfamiliar Python libraries, further exacerbating
  safety concerns. 
* We recommend strict sandboxing when running The AI Scientist, such as
  containerization, restricted internet access (except for Semantic Scholar),
  and limitations on storage usage.
* several unexpected positive results from the lack of guardrails. For example,
  * we had forgotten to create the output results directory in the grokking
    template in our experiments. Each successful run from The AI Scientist
    that outputted a paper automatically caught this error when it occurred and
    fixed it. Furthermore, we found that The AI Scientist would 
* occasionally include results and plots that we found surprising, differing
  significantly from the provided templates. We describe some of these novel
  algorithm-specific visualizations in Section 6.1.

## Broader Impact and Ethical Considerations. While The AI Scientist has the

* The ability to automatically generate and submit papers to academic venues
  could greatly increase the workload for reviewers, potentially overwhelming
  * like in arts (Epstein+ 2023)
  * if the Automated Reviewer tool was widely adopted by reviewers, it could
    diminish the quality of reviews and introduce undesirable biases into the
* papers or reviews that are substantially AI-generated must be marked as such
As with most previous technological advances, The AI Scientist has the
potential to be used in unethical ways. For example, 
* it could be explicitly deployed to conduct unethical research, or even lead
* unintended harm if The AIScientist conducts unsafe research. Concretely, 
* eg if it were encouraged to find novel, interesting biological materials and
  given access to “cloud labs” (Arnold, 2022) where robots perform wet lab
  biology experiments, it could (without its overseer’s intent) create new,
  dangerous viruses or poisons that harm people before we can intervene. 
* Even in computers, if tasked to create new, interesting, functional software,
  it could create dangerous malware. The AIScientist’s current capabilities,
  which will only improve, reinforce that 
* the machine learning community needs to immediately prioritize learning how
  to align such systems to explore in a manner that is safe and consistent with
  our values.
