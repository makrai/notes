# [Intro]

* [in] a weighted undirected network (WUN) ... the concept of node degree can
  be replaced by that of node strength `s_i = sum_j w_{ij}`
* weighted CC: contribution of a triangle can be defined as the 
  * geometric mean of its weights (Onnela et al 2005). or simply as the 
  * product among them (Grindrod 2002). In what follows, 
  * we will focus on the extension ... originally introduced [by Onnela et al]
* Alternative extensions of the CC to weighted or directed networks have been
  recently introduced 
  * in the literature on “network motifs” 
    * topologically-equivalent subgraphs of a network.
  * Onnela+ generalizes the CC to weighted – and possibly directed – networks.
  * Similarly, (Milo et al 2002) compute the recurrence of all types of
    three-node connected subgraphs in a variety of real-world binary directed
    networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology and engineering. 
  * However, the weighted CC in 
    * Onnela+ does not explicitly discriminate between different directed
      triangles (cf. Figure 1), while 
    * Milo+ do not allow for a weighted analysis. 
* This work attempts to bridge the two latter approaches and presents a
  unifying framework where, in addition to the measures already discussed in
  [20, 28], one is able to: (i) explicitly account for directed and weighted
  links; and (ii) define a weighted, directed version of the CC for any type of
  triangle pattern (i.e., 3three-node connected subgraph). To compute such
  coefficients, we shall employ the actual and potential number of
  directed-triangle patterns of any given type.
