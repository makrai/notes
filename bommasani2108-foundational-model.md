* foundation models
  * AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models 8
  (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are
  trained on broad data at scale and are
  adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models to
  * critically central yet incomplete character.
* This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of
  * capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human
    interaction) and
  * technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data,
    systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their
  * applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and
  * societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact,
    legal and ethical considerations). Though
* foundation models are
  * though based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their
  * incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but
    * defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models
    * lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they
* critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary
  collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.
