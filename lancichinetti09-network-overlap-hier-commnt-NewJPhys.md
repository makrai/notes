# Abstract

* mesoscopic level of organization, with groups of nodes forming tightly
* communities or modules, that are only weakly linked to each other. Uncovering
* hierarchical organization, with communities embedded within [each] other
* nodes can be shared between different communities.  Here, 
* we present the first algorithm that finds [overlapping comms and the hier st]
  * based on the local optimization of a fitness function.  Community structure
    * peaks in the fitness histogram.  The 
    * resolution can be tuned by a parameter enabling different hierarchical
* Tests on real and artificial networks give excellent results
