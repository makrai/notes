* a new line of research that seeks automatic metrics for evaluating the
  factuality of machine text. In this paper,
* we introduce GO FIGURE, a meta-evaluation framework for evaluating factuality
  evaluation metrics. We propose
* five necessary and intuitive conditions to evaluate factuality metrics on
  diagnostic factuality data across three different summarization tasks. Our
* our meta-evaluation framework provides a robust and efficient evaluation that
  is extensible to multiple types of factual consistency and standard generation
  metrics, including QA metrics. It also reveals that
* while QA metrics generally improve over standard metrics that measure
  factuality across domains, performance is highly dependent on the way in which
  questions are generated
