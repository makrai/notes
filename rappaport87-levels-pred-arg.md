Levels of lexical representation
1987

* Motivation for the development of theories of predicate-argument
  representation has come from two sources.
  1. must involve generalizations stated over classes of predicators and over
     relations between predicators and their arguments
   * we can make extremely subtle judgements about the grammaticality of novel
     combinations and their possible interpretations. It is implausible
  2. many aspects of the syntax of a clause are determined by the semantics 
   * e.g. Projection Principle of Chomsky (1981). The result has been a shift
* In section 1 we briefly introduce our conception of the syntactically
  relevant predicate-argument representation 
   * the kinds of generalizations which are best stated over this
   * does not contain theta-role labels and 
   * distinguishes among the arguments of a predicator 
     only according to how they combine with the predicator in a sentence 
   * is ... a projection of a more fully elaborated lexical semantic
     representation. An adequate lexical semantic representation 
   * must allow for the identification of natural classes of arguments relevant
     both to 
      * linking rules (Carter, 1976; Ostler, 1979) and to the description of
      * diathesis alternations (Hale and Keyser, 1986, 1987)
* [theta-role label] lists obscure the complex cross-classification of verbs
  according to shared components of meaning
* Section 2.2 discusses how this problem can be overcome by adopting a
  representation involving _predicate decomposition_
