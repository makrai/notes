# 1 The problem of inflection

* Inflection is the morphological marking of morphosyntactic and morphosemantic
  * case, number, person, tense and aspect (among others) on words.  For
  * Morphosyntactic features are inflectional features that play a role in synt
    * e.g. words in specific syntactic contexts agree with respect to the value
    * government: a word or syntactic construction is said to govern the choice
      of a feature value for another word
      e.g. in many languages nouns have to be marked for case, depending on the
      syntactic or semantic role
  * Morphosemantic features are features that are not required by a syntactic
    * e.g. English have a tense property such as present or past. Their choice
    * the choice is obligatory, as a specific tense property has to be chosen.
    * differs from derivation, which is not obligatory
    * context may play a role in the choice of morphosemantic features as well.
      * e.g. presence of the adverb _yesterday_
* inherent and contextual inflection (Booij 1993, 1996; Kibort 2010).
  * Inherent inflection is determined by what the speaker wants to express, and
    * e.g. choice [of] tense and number (singular or plural) for nouns.
  * Contextual inflection: required by syntactic context. This is the case for
    * person and number values for finite verbs in English, which is a matter
  * ‘number’ is inherent for nouns, but contextual for verbs.
  * Case marking on nouns may function as contextual inflection in a language
    * inherent: structural cases. contextual: semantic case marking, which is a
    * e.g. in Latin we can express the instrumental use of a knife by ablative
* purely morphological features e.g. inflectional classes for nouns and verbs.
  * In Latin, five different inflectional classes (declensions) for nouns.
  * inflectional classes for verbs, the conjugations. The patterns described
  * add substantially to the complexity of a
    language, and raise the question how children acquire such morphological
    systems.

In many languages the gender of nouns is marked on related words. For instance,
in Dutch nouns have either common or neuter gender, and this manifests itself
in agreement phenomena: determiner and adjective have to agree in gender and
number with the head noun. However, the nouns themselves do not carry a
morphological marker for gender. Thus, one can only discover the gender of
Dutch nouns indirectly, by looking at agreement data. This is another challenge
for the language learner.

Two interacting but logically distinct issues lie at the core of any linguistic
or psycholinguistic account of inflection:Inflection at the morphology-syntax
interface 231

A. the issue of what syntactic contexts require morphosyntactic and/or mor-
pho-semantic word marking and for what lexical/grammatical units;

B. the issue of how morphosyntactic and morpho-semantic information is overtly
realized on lexical/grammatical units.

In this chapter we mainly focus on the second issue, the ways in which morpho-
syntactic and morphosemantic information is morphologically marked. It must be
observed that there is no one-to-one relationship between inflectional features
and units of form (‘morphs’) in inflected words, as we will see in Section 2:
one morph may express more than one inflectional property (cumulative
exponence), and one inflectional property may be expressed by more than one
feature (extended exponence). Moreover, the same inflectional property may be
expressed in a number of different ways. The patterns of interdependent choices
are expressed by inflectional classes. A simple example from English is that
the past tense forms of verbs may be formed either by means of suffixation of
the stem with -ed, or by means of various types of apophony (Ablaut), i.e.
vowel change in the stem, usually with consequences for the form of
participles. It does not make any difference for the role of the feature value
‘Past’ in syntax and semantics by which formal means it is expressed. This
issue is broached in more detail in Section 2.

Given the lack of a one-to-one mapping of form and meaning in the domain of
inflection, it is useful to introduce paradigms, systematically structured sets
of inflectional forms of words, in order to make the right generalizations and
the proper computations (discussed in Section 5). The nature and structure of
inflectional paradigms are discussed in Section 3.

The inflectional paradigms of words may also contain word combinations.

For instance, in Germanic and Romance languages various inflectional forms can
be treated as consisting of an auxiliary and a non-finite form of a verb.

This is referred to as periphrasis (Section 4).

After this brief sketch of the nature of inflectional systems, we will discuss
in more detail the way inflection is acquired, how machines can learn it, how
it can be modeled computationally and how morphological complexity can be
computed (Sections 5–8). Section 9 will summarize our findings.
