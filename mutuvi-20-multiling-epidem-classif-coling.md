# Abstract

* Multilingual text classification models tend to
  * perform differently across different languages (low-or high-resource),
  * esp when the dataset is highly imbalanced,
    which is the case for epidemiological datasets
* We conduct a comparative study of different machine and deep learning
* dataset comprising news articles related to epidemic outbreaks from
  * six languages, four low-resourced and two high-resourced, in order to
  * analyze the influence
    * language, the struct of the doc, and the size of the data
* results
  * models based on fine-tuned language models exceeds by more than 50% the
    chosen baseline models that include a specialized epidemiological news
    surveillance system and several machine learning models
  * low-resource languages are highly influenced by
    * typology of the languages on which the models have been
      pre-trained or/and fine-tuned
    * model size
  * the beginning and the end of documents provide the most salient features
  * performance of the models was proportionate to the training data size

# 1 Intro

* The classification task entails the identification of texts relevant to
  disease outbreaks from a large collection of data. Considering, for instance,
* we: a comprehensive quantitative study of lowshot text classification models
  applied on a dataset comprising news articles about disease outbreaks
  * English, Greek, French, Russian, Polish, and Chinese.
  * compare SOTA approaches for epidemiological text classification from both
    deep learning and classical machine learning techniques
    by training a variety of models and evaluating them in several
    circumstances, in order to analyze their application in a real-world
  * this is the first extensive study to specifically evaluate the performance
    of multilingual epidemiological text classification methods.
