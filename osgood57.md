## MEANINGS OF "MEANING"

### Linguistic Meaning

American linguists have a split tradition 
  * Bloomfield (1933) 
    * defined the meaning of a linguistic form as "the situation in which the
      speaker utters it and the response which it calls forth in the hearer,"
    * relegating the task to other sciences. 
    * The only judgment about meaning the linguist was required to make ... was
      that of "same or different."
  * Joos (1950); Harris (1951) ... defining it in terms of the total linguistic
    context within which a given sign appears. "Now the linguist's 'meaning' of
    a morpheme ... is by definition the set of conditional probabilities of its
    occurrence in context with all other morphemes (Joos, 1950)." 
  * in connection with the concept of "structure" of [syntax]
