# Introduction

* While loneliness and social isolation may be interrelated, 
  * loneliness is a distinct construct − some people feel “lonely in a crowd”
  * interviews
    * qualitative (e.g., open-ended or semi-structured interviews) and
    * quantitative (e.g., based on the University of California Loneliness Scal)
* nuanced features such as word choice, expressed emotions, and sentence
  structure are not easily assessed by the human eye. Unstructured speech data 
* NLP e.g.  parts-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and parsing) that
  * NLU is a subset of NLP which is more aligned with comprehension of the

      sentiment and emotion analysis.

  * quantitative loneliness assessments 
    with residents of a continuing care senior housing community. The interviews
    were analyzed using NLP to identify differences in transcribed speech
    patterns in lonely versus non-lonely individuals (based on qualitative and
    quantitative assessments).  For this proof-of-concept study, we explored how
    NLP analytic methods could assess whether individuals reported feeling
    lonely in response to a direct question about loneliness (e.g., “Do you feel

    emotion from non-lonely individuals (using qualitative and quantitative)
    * sex differences in the response features.

## Analytic Procedures

* we analyzed the sentiment and emotional content of the responses to the
  loneliness question (Q1) using IBM Watson NLU iv program 33 depicted in Fig 1.
