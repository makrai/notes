# Abstract

* spectral clustering methods
  * algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from
    the data
* issues. First, there are a wide variety of
  * algorithms ... use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways.  Second,
  * many of these algorithms have no proof
* this paper, we present
  * a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few
    lines of Matlab
  * analysis ... Using tools from matrix perturbation theory
  * good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems
