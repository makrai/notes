# Abstract

* two phases
  1. resembles existing methods, but 
    also constructs K classifications of concepts. The second phase 
  2. uses these classifications in developing refined K embeddings for words,
     namely word K-embeddings.  The technique is iterative, scalable, and can
     be combined with other methods (including Word2Vec) in achieving still
     more expressive representations.
* Experimental results show consistently large performance gains on a
  Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set for different K settings
