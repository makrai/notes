Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
J. Hendler and H. Kitano and B. Nebel
2008

the book is divided into three sections:

1. general methods for representing knowledge in AI
  * background on classical logic and theorem proving, then turns to
  * new approaches that
    * extend ... logicâ€”for example, to ... qualitative or uncertain info
    * improve its computational tractability
  * Chapter 9 explains the role of qualitative models of continuous systems
    * reasoning with incomplete information
    * compute ... the possible future states of a system
2. core domains of knowledge, including time, space, causation and action
3. applications: question answering, the Semantic Web, planning, robotics and
   multi-agent systems
