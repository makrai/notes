* Cross-lingual document classification aims at transferring it to a different
* current best eval is the Reuters Corpus Volume 2. However, this subset covers
  * only few languages (English, German, French and Spanish) and 
  * almost all published works focus on the the transfer to German. In
  * the class prior distributions differ significantly between the languages.
    * complicates the evaluation of the multilinguality. In this paper, 
* we propose a new subset of the Reuters corpus 
  with balanced class priors for eight languages. By 
  * adding Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, we cover languages which are
    very different with respect to syntax, morphology, etc. We provide 
  * strong baselines for all language transfer directions using multilingual
    word and sentence embeddings respectively. Our goal is to offer a 
  * freely available framework to evaluate cross-lingual document
    classification, and we hope to foster by these means, research in this
    important area.
