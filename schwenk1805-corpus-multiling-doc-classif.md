* Cross-lingual document classification
* current best eval is the Reuters Corpus Volume 2
  * only few languages (English, German, French and Spanish) and
  * almost all published works focus on the transfer to German
  * the class prior distributions differ significantly between the languages
    * complicates the evaluation of the multilinguality
* we propose a new subset of the Reuters corpus
  with balanced class priors for eight languages
  * adding Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese
    * languages which are very different with respect to syntax, morphology
  * strong baselines for all language transfer directions using multilingual
    word and sentence embeddings
  * freely available framework to evaluate cross-lingual document classif
