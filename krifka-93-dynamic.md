Focus and Presupposition in Dynamic Interpretation

Journal of Sem 1993

# Abstract

* Structured meanings to describe the semantics of focus construictions
  (cf. von Stechow 1990; Jacobs 1991; Krifka 1992)
* In this paper, 1 will show how
  structuired meanings can be combined with a framework of dynamic interpret
  that allows for a cogent expression of
  anaphoric relations and presuppositions
  * in particular on the semantics of the focusing particle _only_ and
    discuss several phenomena that have gone unnoticed or unsolved so far.
    eg introduction of discourse markers in the scope of only and alternatives
    that are anaphorically related to quantifiers. In particular, 1 will show
  * the proposed representation format can handle sentences with
    multiple occurrences of focusing particles. T h e paper also includes a
  * negation with respect to presuppositions, and of principles that govern the
  * focus on quantified NPs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

* This paper is a sequel to Krifka (ig92a), where
  a semantic framework was developed to handle expressions with focusing ops
  including complex cases with multiple focusing operators. There 1
  * independently by von Stechow and Jacobs-structured meanings-and showed how
  * However, I suppressed the fact that
    focusing operators typically introduce presuppositions, and
    treated all semantic conrributions of an operator as assertional
* In this paper I show that structured meanings can be
  combined with a representation format that can express the distinction between
  assertions and presuppositions as well as anaphoric relations

# 2 FOCUS-BACKGROUND STRUCTURES

* focus-sensitive operators
  * potentially challenge compositionality
( I ) a. John only kissed MARY.
      b. John only KISSED Mary.
  * capitalization symbolizes phonological stress.
In both cases the phrase structure is arguably the same; only form a
constituent with the verb phrase hissed Mary. However, the meaning of the
sentences, and hence die meanings of the complex verb phrases containing
only, clearly differ: (a) has a reading (i) saying that the only person John kissed
was Mary, and a reading (ii) saying that the only thing John did was kiss Mary.
(b), in contrast, has a reading saying that the only thing John did to Mary was
that he kissed her. Obviously, the stress location plays a role in these different
readings. When we adhere to the principle of compositionality, and futher-
more agree that the syntactic structures of (a) and (b) are essentially the
same,
then we must accept that the meanings of kissed MARY and KISSED Mary are
different.

There are several ways to express this meaning difference. Here I will
assume that stress marks that certain constituents arc in focus, and that this
focus marking induces a partition of semantic material into a 'focus' part and a
'background' part. This analysis, which has its roots in Jackendoff (1972)
and Dahl (1974) was developed by Jacobs (1983, 1991) and von Stechow
(1982). See von Stechow (1990) for a comparison with an alternative approach,
Rooth ( I 98 5 , I 992).

Stress on Mary in our example either means that the object NP is in focus or
that the whole VP, kissed Mary, is in focus (see von Stechow & Uhlmann 1986
and Jacobs 1991 for the ambiguities of stress marking. Stress on _kissed_ means
that the verb is in focus (or, alternatively, just the past tense morpheme, a
possibility that is not dealt with here). W e can see focus as a feature that
mark a
constituent and we can assume that the different readings of ( i ) are due to
the
position in which that feature appears. The semantic effect of the focus feature
is that it introduces a split of the semantic representation into a background
part and a focus part. As this split is different for the interpretations of
(1a, b)
the meanings of the verb phrases will differ. Many expressions will illustrate
the focus-background split, but operators like only are sensitive to it and will
produce different results when combined with expressions that different in their
background-focus articulation.

In Krifka (1992a) I developed a framework in which the creation,
propagation and utilization of background-focus structures are formally
captured. Background-focus structures are represented as pairs of semantic
representations (B, F), where B can be applied to F, yielding the standard
represemation B(F). The semantic contribution of focus is to crcate such
structures by putting the semantic rcpresentation oft lie constituent with focus
feature into the focus position and an identity function for entities that are of
the type ot the focus into the background position. If a background-focus
structure (13, F) is combined with a semantic representation A that would
normally be combined with the standard meaning B(F), then the background-
focus structure is propagated. More specifically, if the semantic combination
rule calls for a functional application of A to (B, F), then the result will be
<\lambda X[A(B(X))], F>, and if it calls for a functional application of (B, F) to A, then
the result will be (AX[B(X)(A)], F). This ensures that the focus constituent
remains identifiable even in larger semantic representations. A focus-sensitive
operator then takes background-focus structures as arguments and, using the
additional structure they provide, yields a standard expression.

To see how things work let us have a look at the treatment of one reading of
example (la). Here, I use x and y as variables standing for individuals, s as a
variable for situations (which are considered to be a special sort of individuals),
and t as a variable for tuples of individuals of arbitrary length, including length
o (this simplifies certain semantic rules). P is a predicate over tuples of
individuals, T is a second-order predicate variable, and S is a variable over
structured meanings. I specify both the syntactic structure and the incremental
semantic representation in one tree. Capital letters in brackets, like [A], will be
used as abbreviations. Subscript F stands for a focus feature.
