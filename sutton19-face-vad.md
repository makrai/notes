# Abstract

* 1,363 images from seven sets of facial stimuli were normed using the
  self-assessment manikin procedure
  * Each participant provided valence, arousal, and dominance ratings for
    120-130 faces displaying various emotional expressions (eg happiness,
    sadness). The current work provides a large database of normed ratings for
    facial stimuli that
* complements the existing normative set of emotional ratings for photos/words
  * International Affective Picture System and the
  * Affective Norms for English Words
