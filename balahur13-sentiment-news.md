#Abstract

* difference
  * highly subjective text types (movie or product reviews)
    * target is clearly defined and unique across the text
  * news opinion mining is different from that of other text types.  We
    * three subtasks that need to be addressed: 
      * definition of the target; 
      * separation of the good and bad news content from the good and bad
        sentiment expressed on the target; and 
      * analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not
        needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge
  * three ... views on newspaper articles â€“ 
    * author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at the
      time of analysing sentiment.  Given these definitions, we present work on
      mining opinions about entities in English language news, in which (a) 
* we 
  * test the relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we
    attempt to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news.  In
    the experiments described here, we tested 
    * whether or not subject domain-defining vocabulary should be ignored.
      Results showed that this idea is more appropriate in the context of news
      opinion mining and that the approaches taking this into consideration
      produce a better performance.

#Intro

* The EMM applications NewsBrief and MedISys categorise the news into one or
  more of several hundred subject domain classes, including, for instance,
  natural disasters, security, finance, nuclear issues, various diseases,
  organisations, countries, regions, specific conflicts, etc. Categorisation is
  achieved by (often user-defined) Boolean search word expressions or by using
  lists of search words
