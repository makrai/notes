# Abstract

* We introduce a large computational subcategorization lexicon which includes
  * subcategorization frame (SCF) and frequency information for 6,397 English
    verbs. This extensive lexicon was
  * acquired automatically from five corpora and the Web using the current
    version of the comprehensive subcategorization acquisition system of
    Briscoe and Carroll (1997). The lexicon is provided
  * freely for research use, along with a
  * script which can be used to filter and build sub-lexicons

# 1. Introduction

* automatic verb classification, selectional preference acquisition,
  psycholinguistic experiments
  (Lapata+ 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; McCarthy and Carroll, 2003))
* manually developed subcategorized lexicons are available for English, e.g
  * the COMLEX Syntax (Grishman+ 1994) and the
  * ANLT (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987) dictionaries. However, manually built
    lexicons are prone to errors which are difficult to detect automatically
    and it is costly to extend these resources to cover information not
    currently encoded. One important type of information absent from most
* relative frequency of different SCFs for a given predicate ... is highly
  domain-sensitive, i.e. it varies with predominant word senses, which change
  across corpora and domains
* systems ... for both English and other languages, e.g. (Brent, 1993; Briscoe
  and Carroll, 1997; Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Kawahara+ 2000; Ferrer, 2004)
  * gather information about the syntactic aspects of subcategorization (the
    type, number and/or relative frequency of SCFs given specific predicates)
* Briscoe and Carrollâ€™s (1997) comprehensive system
  (Korhonen, 2002b; Korhonen and Preiss, 2003). The lexicon includes SCF

the performance of the large lexicon and a few representative sub-lexicons
