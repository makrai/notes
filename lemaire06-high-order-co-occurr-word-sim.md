* semantic similarity ... is here viewed as association, that is 
  the mental activation of one term when another term is presented, which is
  * association norms capture
* The reason why two words are associated in spite of no co-occurrences could
  be that both co-occur with a third one
  (Livesay & Burgess, 1997; Lowe & McDonald, 2000), even if the 
  * reason for that is in debate (Chwilla & Kolk, 2002)
