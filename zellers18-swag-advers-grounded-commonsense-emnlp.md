SWAG: A Large-Scale Adversarial Dataset for Grounded Commonsense Inference
(Submitted on 16 Aug 2018)

* Given a partial description
  * e.g. "she opened the hood of the car," humans
  * what might come next ("then, she examined the engine"). In this paper, we
* grounded commonsense inference,
  * unifying natural language inference and commonsense reasoning.  We present
  * 113k multiple choice questions about a rich spectrum of grounded situations
* To address the ... challenges of the annotation artifacts and human biases
  * Adversarial Filtering (AF), a novel procedure that constructs a de-biased
  * by iteratively training an ensemble of stylistic classifiers, and using
    them to filter the data. To account for the aggressive adversarial
  * we use SOTA language models to massively oversample a diverse set of
    potential counterfactuals. Empirical results demonstrate that while
* humans can solve the resulting inference problems with high accuracy (88%),
  various competitive models struggle on our task. We provide comprehensive
  analysis that indicates significant opportunities for future research
