* hypernymy prediction: to predict which word in a pair of words such as
  fishâ€“cod is the hypernym and which the hyponym). Most importantly, we
  * datasets for English and for German that the predictions of
  * three methods (WeedsPrec, invCL, SLQS Row) strongly overlap and are
  * predictions highly correlated with frequency-based predictions. In
* nL the second-order method SLQS shows an overall lower accuracy but makes
  correct predictions where the others go wrong
* Our study once more confirms the general need to check the frequency bias of
  a computational method in order to identify frequency-(un)related effects.
