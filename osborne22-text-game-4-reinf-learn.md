# Abstract

* Reinforcement Learning: success in a number of complex virtual environments.
  * hE, many challenges towards solving problems with natural language as a
    core component
  * Interactive Fiction Games (or Text Games) are one such problem type that
    * a set of safe, partially observable environments where
      natural language is required as part of the Reinforcement Learning solut
* this survey’s aim is to
  assist in the development of new Text Game problem settings and solutions for
  Reinforcement Learning informed by natural language. Specifically, this
  survey: 
  * introduces the challenges in Text Game Reinforcement Learning problems, 
  * outlines the generation tools for rendering Text Games and the subsequent
    environments generated, and 
  * compares the agent architectures currently applied
    * systematic review of benchmark methodologies
