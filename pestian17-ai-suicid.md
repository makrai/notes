* computer science provides opportunities to understand suicide thought markers
* we: prospective, multimodal, multicenter, mixed demographic study
* two classes of suicidal thought markers: verbal and nonverbal
  * words and vocal characteristics
  * 379 subjects in three groups: suicidal, mentally ill but not suicidal, contr

# Background

* suicide risks can be roughly clustered into traits or states
  * Trait analyses focus on stable characteristics
    rooted in and measured using biological processes
    (Costanza+ 2014; Le‐Niculescu+ 2013), whereas
  * state analyses measure dynamic characteristics like
    * verbal & nonverbal communication, termed “thought markers” (Pestian+ 15)
* ML and NLP have identified differences in
  retrospective suicide notes, newsgroups, and social media
  (Gomez, 2014; Huang, Goh, & Liew, 2007; Matykiewicz, Duch, & Pestian, 2009)
  * Jashinsky+ (2015) used multiple annotators to identify the risk of suicide
    from the keywords and phrases in geographically based tweets
  * Thompson, Poulin, and Bryan (2014) and Desmet (2014) used text‐based
    signals to identify suicide risk that ranged from 60% to 90%
  * Li, Ng, Chau, Wong, and Yip (2013) presented a framework in web forums;
  * Zhang+ (2015) used microblog data with approximately 90% accuracy
  * Pestian, Matykiewicz, and Grupp‐Phelan (2008)
    * distinguish between notes written by people who died by suicide and simul
    * better than mental health professionals (71% vs. 79%; Pestian+ 2008)
  * international, shared task‐setting (Voorhees+ 2005), 24 teams 
    * identify emos in over 1,319 suicide notes written shortly before death
    * fusion of multiple methods outperform single methods
      (Pestian, Matykiewicz, & Linn‐Gust, 2012)
* prospectively
  * Suicidal Adolescent Clinical Trial (Pestian+ 2015), the single‐site
  * machine learning to analyze interviews with 60 suicidal and control
  * classified patients into suicidal or control groups with greater than 90%
* acoustic features such as pauses and vowel spacing yielded similar results
  (Scherer, Morency, Gratch, Pestian, & Playa Vista, 2015;
  Venek, Scherer, Morency, Rizzo, & Pestian, 2014)
* acoustic characteristics is most helpful
  when classifying between suicidal and mentally ill subjects
