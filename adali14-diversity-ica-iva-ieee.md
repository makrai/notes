#S
* independent component analysis (ICA) 
  * [S]tarting with a simple generative model and the 
    assumption of statistical independence of the underlying components, 
  * decomposes a given set of observations 
    by making use of the diversity in the data, typically 
    in terms of statistical properties of the signal
  * diversity [types]: 
    1. non-Gaussianity—i.e., higher-order statistics (HOS)—or, 
    2. sample dependence
  * independent vector analysis (IVA), 
    recent[ly] generalizes ICA to multiple data sets and adds the use of 
    3. dependence across multiple data sets 
  * both ICA and IVA, when implemented in the complex domain, enjoy the
    4. noncircularity of the sources— underlying components. 
  * Mutual information rate provides a unifying framework such that all these
    statistical properties—types of diversity—can be jointly taken into account
* organization
  * ICA, and then ... IVA, ... both using mutual information rate
  * conditions for the identifiability of the given linear mixing model and
    derive the performance bounds. We address 
    how various methods fall under this umbrella and give 
    examples of performance for a few sample algorithms 
    compared with the performance bound. We then discuss the 
  * importance of approaching the performance bound depending on the goal
  * medical image analysis as the motivating example.
