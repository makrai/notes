* foundation models
  * AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models 8
  * eg, BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3
  * trained on broad data at scale and are
  * adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks
  * critically central yet incomplete
* This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks
  * capabilities (eg, language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction)
  * technical principles(eg, model architectures, training procedures, data,
    systems, security, evaluation, theory)
  * applications (eg, law, healthcare, education) and
  * societal impact (eg, inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact,
    legal and ethical considerations)
* foundation models are
  * though based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their
  * incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but
    * defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models
    * lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail
* critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary
  collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature
