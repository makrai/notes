# Abstract

* it is indeed difficult to clearly distinguish and define the boundaries
  between different emotion categories. The existing studies working on emotion
* we propose a general framework to learn the distributed representations for
  emotion categories in emotion space from an emotion classification dataset.
* based on the soft labels predicted by the pre-trained neural network model,
  we derive a simple and effective algorithm.
* Experiments: much better than word vectors in semantic space

# Conclusion

* future work we would like to explore
  * corpus-indep distributed representations for emotion categories are derived
  * the computation of our emotion representations relies on the soft labels
    predicted by the neural network model, and we would like to investigate a
    more general method in the future. Finally, we would like to explore more
  * applications: improving the performance of emotion classification models
  * emotion spaces across languages
