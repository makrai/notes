Modern Grammars of Case
John M. Anderson
2006

# Prologue

* creativity in language
  * involves the capacity to formulate representations for newly perceived
    ‘scenes’ and to decode them, possibly in novel situations; and it
  * includes more lexical than syntactic capacities. This capacity
  * depends on an understanding of figurativeness, which,
    * despite the relative routinization, or institutionalization, involved in
      lexicalization and grammaticalization, is
    * basic to the structure and development of both lexical and grammar
* organization: three parts, followed by an Epilogue. Part I,
  1. ‘The Tradition’, discusses the evolution of grammars of case
    * terminating in the chapter on the identity of semantic relations
    * The boundary between Parts I and II cuts across localism:
      * both the latter part of Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 are concerned with it
      * one reason for this is chronology
      * proposed incorporation of the ‘localist hypothesis’ into ‘case grammar’
  2. ‘The Implementation of the Category of Case’
    * there is also an attempt to give attention to studies that do not
      regard itself as ‘case grammar’ e.g. ‘macro-roles’ and ‘abstract syntax’
    * the categorial character of ‘case’ in the wide sense
    * divided from Part III by a difference in focus within the grammar
  3. ‘Case Grammar as a Notional Grammar’
    * ‘case’ is typical of syntactic categories in being semantically grounded:
    * the role of ‘case’ in eliminating appeal to syntactic transformations
      and other syntactic paraphernalia, in favour of simple projections from a
      richly structured but formally parsimonious lexicon
  * Epilogue which tries to draw together the main results, as I see them
    * some extensions and further consequences of the main traditions
    * novel analyses also in the discussion of localism in Chapter 6
    * ideas whose development is as informative as the snap-shots
    * e.g. the treatment of passives or causatives is recurrently modified in
      the light of conceptual shifts

# 5 The Identity of Semantic Relations

* three main approaches to the identification of ‘case’ and ‘cases’
  1. distribution of individual semantic relations
  1. contrast and complementarity or criterial approaches
    * appeals to the distribution of ‘cases’ in general with respect to
      * the items which are subcategorized for them and
      * their role in ‘case frames’ and to
      * restrictions on their syntax
  1. the content of case
    * the atomistic approach to the semantics of ‘cases’
    * define what characterizes the category of ‘case’ itself substantively,
    * the distribution of the category and its members, the ‘cases’
    * a link to the chapter that follows
* The first two approaches attempt to 
  complement the semantic definitions of ‘cases’ with distributional

## 5.1 Distributional criteria for particular ‘cases’ 92

## 5.2 General criteria: principles of ‘complementarity’ and ‘contrast’ 95

* largely originates in Fillmore’s (1971) proposal
* determined by the relationships
  * between ‘case’ and its accompanying argument and
  * between ‘case’ and its head (to put it in dependency terms)
* principle of ‘contrast’ that is
  * particularly easily exemplified by subjects.  In terms of the principle,
  * if the subject of a class of predicators shows systematic ambiguity
    and only one of the readings is available with a different set ...,
    a contrast  can be posited  with the first class of predicators
* ‘complementarity’ (Fillmore 1971
  * controls The proliferation of distinctions in ‘case’
  * where distinctions in semantic relation
    can rather be ascribed to other elements in the structures

## 5.3 The ineluctability of ‘case’ 103

* The mainstream of modern linguistics inherited the view that there were two
  kinds of case, the grammatical and the local or notional
* Anderson's articulation of localism differs from Hjelmslev’s
  * Some of the differences are contingent esetleges,
    depending on the syntactic-derivationalist orientation of Anderson
  * Others are more fundamental, as we shall see

## 5.4 Localist grammars of case 107

* one tradition that attempts to arrive at a comprehensive theory of ‘case’
  compatible with the overall Fillmorean position, the ‘localist’ tradition
  described and formulated in Hjelmslev (1935/7)
  * we return to arguments for the basicness of semantic relations in §6.3

5.4.1 The insufficiency of ‘criteria’
5.4.2 Hjelmslev and localism
5.4.3 A localist interpretation of ‘datives/experiencers’

## 5.5 Conclusion and prospect

# 6 Localist Case Grammar

# Epilogue

* the main tenets of the ‘case grammar’ hypothesis, especially the
  * fundamental syntactic status of ‘case relations’, and the
  * irrelevance of a syntactic ‘deep structure’
  * the (at best) derivative status of grammatical relations
* earlier history of the ‘localist hypothesis’ is charted by Hjelmslev
  (1935/7)
* Chapter 6: motivations for an inventory of localist semantic relations
  abs source loc loc{source}
  * expanded to introduce the second-degree feature {goal},
    also clearly localist, in relation to absolutive and the simple locative
