Agency and voice: The semantics of the Semitic templates
2003

# Abstract

* Semitic templates systematically encode two dimensions of verb meaning:
  * agency, the thematic role of the verb’s external argument, and
  * voice assumption that this form-meaning correspondence is
* mediated by syntax
  * parallel compositional construction of the form and the meaning of a verb
    from the forms and the meanings of its root and template
  * unmarked, simple templates:
    * The root and its arguments are optionally embedded under a light verb v
      which introduces the agent (Hale and Keyser 1993; Kratzer 1994)
  * Two dimensions of markedness are
    introduced by two additional types of syntactic heads:
    * agency heads, which modify agency and are morphologically realized as the
      intensive and causative templates, and
    * voice heads, which modify voice and are morphologically realized as the
      passive and middle templates
* Causative and middle morphemes within a unified system
  * explains that, crossling, both are markers of transitivity alternations
  * sheds new light on problems in the interface of semantics and morphology
    * the impossibility of deriving the semantics of middle verbs from that of
      the corresponding transitive verbs
    * identity found crosslinguistically between middle and reflexive morphology
    * determining the grammatical function of the causee in causative constructs

# 1 Causative and middle morphology as marking transitivity alternations

* typological literature (Nedyalkov and Silnitsky 1973; Haspelmath 1993)
* languages which overtly mark a transitivity alternation vary in their choice
  of the marked alternant
  * the transitive verb may be marked as causative, or
  * the intransitive verb may be marked as middle, 1 a
    * The term middle is used in this paper in its general sense:
      marking a transitivity alternation
      rather than in its narrower dispositional sense
      found in “This bread cuts easily.”
    * marking often identical to the marking of lexical reflexivity
* eg (1)
  * _finish_
    * middle intransitive alternant marked in Hebrew, but a
    * causative transitive one in Turkish
  * freeze, on the other hand
    * causative transitive alternant marked in Hebrew, but a
    * middle intransitive one in Spanish:
* Haspelmath (1993): typological generalization
  * no single language reverses the Hebrew pattern of marking in (1)
    ie the combination of Turkish and Spanish was needed to exemplify this
  * a universal ranking of predicates
* the theoretical literature:
  * causative and middle verbs not values of a single alternation. Rather,
  * in lexicalist and non-lexicalist theories alike
  * middles involve a single predicate,
  * causatives are usually constructed from two predicates (event decomposition)
  * Middles (including reflexives) have been given
    * non-lexical analyses based on syntactic relations (Kayne 1975; Moore 1991)
    * lexicalist analyses based on argument structure (Marantz 1984)
      * Romance: they are marked by a clitic
        (Grimshaw 1982, 1990; Alsina 1996; Miller and Sag 1997)
  * Causativization, on the other hand, is often taken to involve two preds
    * eg1 periphrastic Romance and Korean causative constructions
    * eg2 morphologically marked causatives in Turkish
    * Non-lexicalist analyses: they are biclausal at some syntactic level
      * the generalized transformational account of Kuroda (1965)
      * the Predicate Raising analysis of Kayne (1975) and Aissen (1979)
      * the Clause Union analysis of Relational Grammar
        (references in Gibson and Raposo 1986)
      * the Verb Incorporation analyses
        * Marantz (1985), Baker (1988), and Li (1990)
    * Lexicalist analyses: the causative sentence is syntactically monoclausal,
      * Rosen (1990), Alsina (1996), Miller (1992), and Aranovich (2002)
* unified analysis
  * In view of the typological observation that
    causatives and middles often mark a single alternation, it is compelling
  * assume a single predicate, as
    it seems unnatural to analyse middles as involving two predicates
  * Until now, only lexicalists have analyzed the causative using a single pred
    (Aissen and Hankamer 1980; Williams 1981; DiSciullo and Williams 1987;
    Alsina 1992; Katada 1997)
  * we: a non-lexicalist unified analysis, based on Semitic template morphology
  * In the Semitic languages, causative and middle verbs alike are derived by
    particular templates
  * we: the Semitic templates denote
    * voice (of which middle is one possible value) and a
    * thematic dimension which I call agency (of which causative is one possib)
  * we analyse causative verbs in terms of a causative templat
  * not equivalent to an analysis in terms of an additional causative pred
  * A causative template is restricted to denote a particular thematic role,
  * not the same as introducing a predicate in general
  * implic
    * only one argument with each thematic role
      * if a causative verb involves a single predicate, we do
        not expect two of its arguments to have the same thematic role, but
      * if two predicates are involved, then it should be possible to find two
        arguments with the same thematic role
    * a single event: if a causative verb involves a single predicate
* our analysis differs from those of Parsons (1990) and Pustejovsky (1995),
  * P & P: causative verbs denote two separate events
  * we: a causative verb describes a single event which has
    a causer participant
  * Parsons's evidence in favour of the two-event analysis is based on the
    ambiguity of the adverbial _behind the museum_ in the following example

           _Mary flew her kite behind the museum._ (3, mögé, mögött)

  * Parsons attributes this ambiguity to the fact that
    the adverbial may modify either of the two events
  * the spatial location of an event is less well defined than its temporal
    * the spatial location of an event is the spatial location of one of its
      participants, and I think this is the source of the ambiguity of (3)
  * the same ambiguity is attested for verbs that are not causative

                     a. Mary wrote the poem on the floor.
                     b. Mary saw Bill on the bus.

* Another argument for the complexity of causal events is based on Dowty (1979)

        (5) John closed the door again.  (újra becsukta, visszacsukta)

  * (5) can mean, according to Dowty, either that
    * the whole accomplishment of closing the door is repeated or that
    * only the result state is repeated
  * not hold for causative verbs in general. 
    just for particular aspectual classes
    (6a and b) below cannot mean that a single human act caused more walks/gallops
                        6. a. _I walked the dog again._
                        6. b. _Kétszer megvágtáztattam a lovat_
* In sum: the causal source of an event is part of its characterization

---

* intensive morphology in the Semitic system
  * causative morphology is not the only way to systemat characterize an event
    * realized as the causative template
  * The intensive template systematically characterizes an event as an action
  * event decomposition would not be appropriate for this type of chariz
  * the diff temlates characterize the same event by diff thematic relations:
    * causative template: causer relation 
    * intensive template: the actor relation
* why not lex?
  1. The existence of the template as an independent morphological unit
    lends support to the view of argument structure advocated by non-lexicalists
    eg Hale and Keyser (1993) and Kratzer (1994)
    * the external argument is an argument of a func head, here the template
    * the thematic role of the ext arg is 
      determined by a morpheme (the template),
      in causative and intensive verbs alike
    * unexpected under lexicalist views of argument structure, where
      the external argument is an argument of the basic predicate
      (Bresnan and Kanerva 1989; Pollard and Sag 1994)
  2. in lexicalist theories, the crossling identity between the middle and the
     reflexive morphemes is mystery,
    * Chierchia’s (1989): middle and reflexive verbs have identical semantics.
    * this view is not tenable, as will be shown in section 2 below
    * Lexicalist views based on Marantz (1984)
      attribute the identity of middle and reflexive morphemes to the fact that
      both “perform the same function: that of
      dethematizing the [NP, IP] position and
      suspending the assignment of structural accusative Case”
      (Cinque 1988, p.  566, attributed to R. Kayne; see Grimshaw 1990 as well)
    * hE the different semantics of middles and reflexives does
      not follow from this fact
    * we: a non-lexicalist solution to this puzzle

# 2 The semantics of causatives and middles

* lexical decomposition approach to causative verbs
  (Dowty 1976, 1979; Van Valin and LaPolla 1997)
  based on the work of the generative semanticists (Lakoff 1970; McCawley 1968)
  1. several drawbacks as an account for transitivity alternations
    * the transitive verb is derived from the basic verb by the operator CAUSE
    * we expect a more highly marked morphology for it
    * hE sometimes it is the intransitive verb which is morphologically marked
      by the middle morpheme, as exemplified in (1) and (2) above
  2. the identity of the middle morpheme with the reflexive morpheme unexpected
    * The reflexive morpheme presumably denotes a different operator REFL
    * unrelated to CAUSE (where REFL = λP λx [P(x, x)])
* Chierchia (1989) goes in the opposite direction from that of lexical decomp
  * the transitive verb is basic and the middle verb from is derived
  * the converse of the first problem: even in languages with middle morphology,
    it is not necessarily the case that the transitive verb is unmarked; often,
    it is the transitive verb which is marked (as causative) – see (1) and (2)
* semantic problem. The problem is that there is
  * no way to “eliminate” the semantic contribution of the transitive verb’s
    external argument
  * a middle verb does not involve existentially binding the external argument
    of the transitive verb
    * Unlike passive
  * The sentence _The vase broke_ does not entail that somebody/something
    broke the vase
  * how to derive the meaning of unaccusative _break_ from that of transitive
    * if x broke the vase would be considered false for any x,
      we might still consider it true that the vase broke
  * So what are the truth conditions for _The vase broke?_
    * problem ignored in the literature, except for Chierchia’s discussion
  * Chierchia: derive the meaning of the middle verb from that of the trans
    * assign to _The vase broke_ the truth conditions of _The vase broke itself_
  * arguing in the following way:
  * There are three semantic operations which correspond to the morphological
    reduction of any argument of a dyadic verb
    * existential binding of the external argument: the passive,
    * exist binding of the internal argument in unspecified object deletion,
    * binding of the internal to the external argument in reflexivization
  * the reduction of an argument in middle verbs
    most closely matches reflexivization
    * The view that the argument structure of unaccusative verbs can be traced
      back to reflexivity (whether or not they exhibit middle morphology) is
      also found in Grimshaw (1982), Wehrli (1986), DiSciullo and Williams
      (1987), Brousseau and Ritter (1990)
    * reduction, of lexical reflexivity to unaccusativity, is argued for in
      Zribi-Hertz (1987), Marantz (1984), and Grimshaw (1990)
    * criticism of this view in Reinhart and Siloni (2003)
  * ie middle morphology attributes the instigation of the denoted event
    to the patient itself
    * also accounts for the observation that unaccusatives and reflexives
      often share the middle morphology, as exemplified here from Romance
* In Hebrew as well, middle morphology  marks both unaccusative and reflexive
  * middle is either simple middle niCCaC or intensive middle hitCaCeC

## Arguments against the reduction of unaccusativity to reflexivity 7

* not satisfactory to represent the semantics of the Hebrew unaccusative
  _be born_ as ‘give birth to oneself’, nor
  _become vacant_ as ‘vacate oneself’
  * In these particular examples, unaccus event brought about by another partic
* why middles vary with respect to the unergative/unaccusative classification
  * eg In Romance, middles are difficult to classify as either unaccus or unerg
  * Italian,
    auxiliary selection and participation in participial adverbial clauses
    point in the direction of unaccusativity, yet
    reflexives fail the ne-cliticization test of unaccusativity (Alsina 1996)
  * split among non-reflexive middle verbs into unaccusative and unergative
    * In Hebrew, middle verbs which are interpreted as
      * reflexive are unergative, eg nidxaf ‘push oneself’ and hitraxec ‘wash
      oneself’ in (7d)
      * non-reflexive may be either unaccusative or unergative
        * ni bar ‘break’ and hitpareq ‘fall apart’ in (7c) are unaccusative, but
        * many others are unergative
    * found in Spanish as well (Aranovich 2000)
* Two tests for unaccusativity in Hebrew (Borer and Grodzinsky 1986)
  * Unaccusative verbs, but not unergative verbs, allow
    * verb-first clauses 

        (9) fell-apart-MID the chair when Dani entered to-the bathroom
            *washed-MID the child when Dani entered to-the bathroom
            (hu: coming into existence)

    * the addition of a Possessive Dative argument (as in 10a, b)

                     (10) the chair fell-apart-MID to-Ruti

  11. resultative phrases
    may be predicated of the argument of unaccusative but not unergative verbs:

                     (11) a. the chair broke-MID to pieces
                             darabokra tört
                          b. `*`the armies fought-MID to pieces
                             darabokra harcolt

* unaccusative/unergative split among middle verbs (Reinhart 1996, Simmons 1996)
  (though R & S only discuss intensive-template verbs)
  * it is possible to predict on the basis of the agentivity of the transitive
    whether its middle counterpart is reflexive or unaccusative:
  * agentive verbs give rise to reflexive middles, whereas
  * non-agentive verbs give rise to unaccusative middles
* hE 
  * agentivity of the transitive verb ?=> reflexivity of its middle form
    * in many cases it is indeed so,
      in conformity with the crosslinguistic study of Haspelmath (1993)
    * Haspelmath: agentivity of the transitive verb
      prevents the derivation of an unaccusative verb,
      since unaccusative implies the absence of an agent
    * possible readings (!= morphology)
      * reflexive
        * a reading where the subject has others perform the action on him/her,
          or otherwise does whatever it takes to achieve the same result
        * in general an available reading for reflexive morphology, 
          eg in Russian, Armenian, Georgian, and Gilyak, 
          alongside the reflexive
          (cf. Nedyalkov and Silnitsky 1973)
        * (12a–c) illustrate for Hebrew:
          lefényképezkedik, lenyiratkozik, kirugatja magát
      * iterative reading. This reading too is found crosslinguistically
        * Russian, Hungarian, Georgian according to Nedyalkov and Silnitsky (1973)
        * Examples from Hebrew are in (13)
        * futkározik, sétálgat, röpköd, nevetgél
  * Lack of agentivity of the transitive verb !=> unaccusativity of the middle
    * Some unergative middles correspond to experiencer rather than agentive
       verbs, as in (14a, b), noted already by Reinhart
    * Other unergative middles do not correspond to verbs at all, but to nouns,
       as in (14c, d), or to adjectives, as in (14e, f):

    (14) meglepődik, kiábrándul, 
         gyerek(es)kedik, nyul(as)kodik, lustá(l)kodik, beteg(es)kedik

  * middle verbs that are reflexive or unaccus depending on the argument, as
    shown in (15), already observed by Borer and Grodzinsky (1986)

       (15) c.  A gyerek/az osztyály elmaradt
            e.  A méreg kiürült a szervezetből/A szervezet kiürült

* sum: no way to predict the unaccusative/reflexive classification of middles
  if one derives them from their transitive counterparts (p 11)
