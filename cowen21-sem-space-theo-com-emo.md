# Abstract

* affective science
  * animated by basic emotion theory and constructivist accounts
  * the central line of inquiry has been the
    search for one-to-one mappings between six emotions and their
    subj experiences, prototypical expressions, and underlying brain states
* We: semantic space theory. This computational approach uses
  * wide-ranging naturalistic stimuli and open-ended statistical techniques to
    capture systematic variation in emotion-related behaviors. Upwards of
  * 25 varieties of emotional experience have
    distinct proﬁles of associated antecedents and expressions
  * These emotions are high-dimensional, categorical, and often blended. This
  * these emos organize emotional experience, expression, and neural processing
