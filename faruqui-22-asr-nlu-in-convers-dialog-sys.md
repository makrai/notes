# Abstract

* more users across the world are interacting with dialog agents in their days
  * need for better speech understanding that calls for renewed attention to
  * dynamics between research in
    automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU)
* We briefly review these research areas and lay out the current relationship
  * NLU should be cognizant of the ASR models being used upstream in a dialog
    system’s pipeline,
  * ASR should be able to learn from errors found in NLU,
  * there is a need for end-to-end data sets that provide
    semantic annotations on spoken input,
  * there should be stronger collaboration between ASR and NLU research
