The naive physics manifesto
1979

# 0. Intro

* I propose the construction of a formalization of a sizable portion of
  common-sense knowledge about the everyday physical world
  * objects, shape, space, movement, substances (solids and liquids), time
* along the way I will outline the theory of meaning which this proposal
  assumes

# 1. The proposal: a summary

* not to
  * develop a new formalism to express this knowledge
    * formalism-hacking may become necessary in due course
    * existing, well-understood formalisms have many ... possibilities
  * write a program which can solve problems, or plan actions, or whatever
    * control and search issues -- in short, computational issues
* characteristics
  * thoroughness [i.e. coverage]
  * fidelity. It should be reasonably detailed
  * Density. The ratio of facts to concepts needs to be fairly high
    * the units have to have lots of slots
  * uniformity
    * a common formal framework (language, system, etc.) for the whole
      formalization, so that the inferential connections between the different
      parts (axioms, frames,...) can be clearly seen
    * it is methodologically important to allow the use of a variety of
      formalisms [in sub-areas]
    * [but] idiosyncratic formalisms [should be] systematically reducible to
      the basic formalism: they will be regarded as 'semantic sugar'

# 2 What the proposal isn't

* not a program
  * [demos] divert attention from the main goal
* not proposed to develop a new formalism or language
  * I propose ... that first~order logic is a suitable basic vehicle for
    representation
    1. important point is ... that the formalism has a clear interpretation
    2. idiosyncratic notation may sometimes be useful for idiosyncratic
       sub-theories
      * physical states of fluids as ... states of an FSM (Hayes 1978b)
    3. FOL needs to be extended.I have already found two tensions
      * quotation, so that the formalism can describe its own formulae
      * non-unique Skolem function, similar to Hilbert’s $\epsilon$-symbol
      * default

# 3.The axiom-concept graph: clusters and density

# 4.The a/c ratio and reductionist formalizations

# 5. Meanings, model theory, and fidelity

# 6.Thoroughness and closure

# 7. Some likely clusters and their concepts

## 7.4 Histories: describing happenings

* The now-classical approach to describing actions and change, pioneered by
  John McCarthy, is to use the concept of state or situation
* snapshots of the world at a given moment: 
  actions and events are then functions from states to states
* I now think however, that is a mistake or at least a gross over-amplification
* e.g. Two people in New York agree to meet a week later in London
* What we need is a notion of a state of an event which has a restricted
  spatial extent
* By a _history_ I mean such an object, viz. a connected piece of space-time
  physically bounded on all four dimensions, in which ‘something happens’
