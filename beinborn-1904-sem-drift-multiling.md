* an adapted version of representational similarity analysis of a selected set
  of concepts in computational multilingual representations.  Using this
* we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree that closely resembles those assumed by
  linguistic experts.  These results indicate that
* multilingual distributional representations which are
  only trained on monolingual text and bilingual dictionaries preserve relations
  between languages without the need for any etymological information.  In
* we propose a measure to identify semantic drift between language families. We
  perform experiments on word-based and sentence-based multilingual models and
  provide both quantitative results and qualitative examples.  Analyses of
  * two purposes: indicate unwanted characteristics of the computational models
  * provide a quantitative means to study linguistic phenomena across languages.
