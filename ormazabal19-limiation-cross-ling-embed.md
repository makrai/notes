Analyzing the Limitations of Cross-lingual Word Embedding Mappings 

# Abstract

* it is not clear whether [the isomorphism assumption] is an inherent
  limitation of mapping approaches or a more general issue when learning
  cross-lingual embeddings. So as to answer this question, 
* we experiment with parallel corpora, which allows us to 
  * compare offline mapping to an extension of skip-gram that jointly learns
  * joint learning yields to more isomorphic embeddings, is 
    * less sensitive to hubness, and obtains stronger results in bilingual
