# Abstract

* this paper: how useful are multiling sentence embed in intent classif
* using Zero-shot learning
* Several machine learning models were developed & their outputs were compared
* the Language Agnostic Sentence Representations or LASER which uses a single
  encoder to give sentence embedding vector for sentences in any language
