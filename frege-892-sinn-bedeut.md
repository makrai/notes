On Sense and Reference
Gottlob Frege

* Equality gives rise to challenging questions
  * in the sense of identity,
  * I understand `a = b` to have the sense of
    `a is the same as b` or `a and b coincide.`
  * Is it a relation?
    * between objects, or between [names or signs of objects]?
    * In my Begriffsschrift1 I assumed the latter. The
    * reasons which seem to favour this are the following:
      * a = a and a = b are obviously statements of differing cognitive value;
      * a = a holds a priori and, according to Kant, is to be labelled analytic,
      * a = b often contain very valuable extensions of our knowledge and cannot
        eg
          * The discovery that the rising sun is not new every morning, but
      * if we were to regard equality as a relation between the designations,
        a = b could not differ from a = a
        * A relation would thereby be expressed of a thing to itself, and indeed
          one in which each thing stands to itself but to no other thing.
  * What is intended to be said by a = b seems to be that
    the signs or names `a` and `b` designate the same thing, so that those signs
    * this relation would hold between the names or signs only in so far as
      they named or designated something. It would be mediated by
  * the sentence a = b would refer to their mode of designation; we would
    express no proper knowledge by its
  * If the sign `a` is distinguished from the sign `b` as
    * only as object (here, by means of its shape),
    * not as sign (i.e. not by the manner in which it designates something),
    the relation becomes cognitively trivial
  * A difference can arise only if the difference between the signs corresponds
    to
    a difference in the mode of presentation of that which is designated
    * eg Let a, b, c be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle with the
    * The point of intersection of a and b is then the same as
      the point of intersection of b and c
      So we have different designations for the same point, and
      these names [the descriptions] likewise indicate the mode of presentation;
      and hence the statement contains actual knowledge.
* for every sign (name, combination of words, letter), there is connected
  * that to which the sign refers, which may be called the reference
  * what I should like to call the sense of the sign,
    wherein the mode of presentation is contained.

  * the reference/not the sense of the expressionss
    `the point of intersection of a and b` and `the point of intersection of..`
     `evening star` vs `morning star,`
* by `sign` and `name` I have here understood
  any designation representing a proper name, which thus
  has as its reference a definite object (this word taken in the widest range),
  but not a concept or a relation, which shall be discussed in another article
  * can also consist of several words or other signs. For brevity,
  * let every such designation be called a proper name.
* The sense of a proper name is grasped by everybody who is sufficiently
  familiar with the language (= totality of designations) to which it belongs;

    opinions as to the sense may differ. It might, for instance, be taken to be
    * eg: the pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. Anybody who does
  * So long as the reference remains the same, such variations may be tolerated,
  * are to be avoided in the theoretical structure of a demonstrative science
    and ought not to occur in a perfect language.
  * but proper name serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the reference,
    supposing it to have one
    * Comprehensive knowledge of the reference would require us to be able to
      say immediately whether any given sense belongs to it.
      To such knowledge we never attain.
* The regular connexion between a sign, its sense, and its reference is of such a
  * to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and
    to that in turn a definite reference, while
    to a given reference (an object) there does not belong only a single sign.
  * The same sense has different expressions in different languages or even in
    the same language
    * exceptions to this regular behaviour occur
    * but natural languages [is often ambiguous], and
      one must be content if a word has the same sense in the same context
  * every grammatically well-formed expression representing a proper name always
    has a sense
  * But this is not to say that to the sense there also corresponds a reference.
  * eg `the celestial body most distant from the Earth` have a sense, but no ref
    * `the least rapidly convergent series` has a sense but no reference, since
* words are used in the ordinary/meta way, what one intends to speak of is their
  reference/sense
  * meta: one wishes to talk about the words themselves or their sense. This
  * eg when the words of another are quoted
  * One's own words then first designate words of the other speaker, and only
* In reported speech one talks about the sense eg of another person's remarks.
  * words do not have their customary reference but
    designate what is usually their sense. In order to have a short expression,
  * we will say indirect use/reference. We distinguish accordingly the customary
* The reference and sense of a sign != the associated idea
  * the reference of a sign is an object perceivable by the senses,
    my idea of it is an internal image,`*`
  * idea arising from memories of
  sense impressions which I have had and
  acts, both internal and external, which I have performed.
  * Such an idea is often
    * saturated with feeling;
    * the clarity of its separate parts varies and oscillates
  * The same sense is not always connected with the same idea.
  * The idea is subjective: one man's idea is not that of another
    * a painter, a horseman, and a zoologist will probably connect different
      ideas with the name `Bucephalus.` This constitutes an essential
  * the sign's sense may be the common property of many ideas and therefore is
    not a part or a mode of the individual mind
* is the sense subjective in the same way as the idea?
  * there still remains a difference in the mode of connexion. They are not
  * an exact comparison of ideas is not possible, because we cannot have both
    ideas together in the same consciousness.
* The reference of a proper name is the object itself which we designate by its
  * the idea, which we have in that case, is wholly subjective;
  * in between lies the sense, which is indeed no longer subjective

  * A proper name (word, sign, sign combination, expression) expresses its

  * how do you know that the name `the Moon`/anything has any reference? How do
  * when we say `the Moon,` we do not intend to speak of our idea or the sense

  * need not be answered here;
    in order to justify mention of the reference of a sign it is enough, at
    first, to point out our intention in speaking or thinking. (We must then add
    the reservation: provided such reference exists.)
* sense and reference for an entire declarative sentence.
  * a sentence contains a thought
    * not the subjective performance of thinking but its objective content,
      which is capable of being the common property of several thinkers.
  * Is this thought, now, to be regarded as its sense or its reference? Let us
  * assume now that the sentence has reference. If we now
  * replace one word of the sentence
    by another having the same reference, but a different sense,
    this can have no bearing upon the reference of the sentence
    Yet we can see that in such a case the thought changes; since, e.g., the
  * eg `The morning/evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun` differs from
  * The thought, accordingly, cannot be the reference of the sentence, but must
    rather be considered as the sense
  * Is it possible that a sentence as a whole has only a sense, but no ref? At
    * just as there are parts of sentences having sense but no reference. And
    * yes, sentences which contain proper names without reference will be of
      The sentence _Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep_
      obviously has a sense.
    * But since it is doubtful whether the name `Odysseus`, has reference, it is
      also doubtful whether the whole sentence has one. ret
    * anyone who seriously took the sentence to be true or false
      would ascribe to the name `Odysseus` a reference, not merely a sense; for
      it is of the reference of the name that the predicate is affirmed or
      denied. Whoever
      does not admit the name has reference can
neither apply nor withhold the predicate. But in that case it would be
superfluous to advance to the reference of the name; one could be satisfied with
the sense, if one wanted to go no further than the thought. If it
were a question only of the sense of the sentence, the thought, it would be
unnecessary to bother with the reference of a part of the rentence;
  * only the sense, not the reference, of the part is relevant to the sense of
    the whole sentence. The thought remains the same whether `Odysseus` has
    reference or not
  * The fact that we concern ourselves at all about the reference of a part of
    the sentence indicates that we generally recognize and expect a reference
    for the sentence itself
    * The thought loses value for us as soon as we recognize that the reference
      of one of its parts is missing. We are
therefore justified in not being satisfied with the sense of a sentence,
and in inquiring also as to its reference
* But now why do we want every proper name to have a reference? Why is the
  * Because we are concerned with its truth value. This is
  * not always the case.  In hearing an epic poem, for instance, we are interest
    * euphony of the language, sense of the sentences and the images and
      feelings thereby aroused
    * The question of truth would cause us to abandon aesthetic delight for an
* signs having only sense =: representations,
* the words of the actors on the stage would be representations; indeed the
  actor himself would be a representation
* We have seen that
  the reference of a sentence may always be sought,
  whenever the reference of its components is involved; and that this is the
  * when and only when we are inquiring after the truth value.
* the truth value of a sentence as constituting its reference. By
  * the truth value of a sentence = whether it is true or false.
For brevity I call the one the True, the other the False. Every declarative
sentence concerned with the reference of its words is therefore to be
regarded as a proper name, and its reference, if it has one, is either the
True or the False. These two objects are recognized, if only implicitly, by
everybody who judges something to be true -and so even by a sceptic.
The designation of the truth values as objects may appear to be an
arbitrary fancy or perhaps a mere play upon words, from which no
profound consequences could be drawn. What I mean by an object can
be more exactly discussed only in connexion with concept and relation. I
will reserve this for another article. But so much should already be clear,
that in every judgment, no matter how trivial, the step from the level of
thoughts to the level of reference (the objective) has already been taken.

* One might be tempted to regard the relation of the
  thought to the True not as that of
  sense to reference, but rather as that of
  subject to predicate.
* Subject and predicate (in the logical sense) are indeed elements of thought;
  they stand on the same level for knowledge
  * By combining subject and predicate, one reaches only a thought,
    never passes from sense to reference, never from a thought to its truth val
* the reference of a sentence is its truth value is correct
  => truth must remain unchanged when a part of the sentence is replaced by an
    expression having the same reference. And this is in fact the case. Leibniz
    gives the definition: _Eadem sunt, quae sibi mutuo substitui possunt, salva
    veritate._ What else but the truth value could be found, that belongs quite
    generally to every sentence if the reference of its components is relevant,
    and remains unchanged by substitutions of the kind in question?
  * Judgments can be regarded as advances from a thought to a truth value.
    * judgments are distinctions of parts within truth values. Such distinction
    * by a return to the thought
    * To every sense there would correspond its own manner of analysis. However, I
    * I have transferred the relation between the parts and the whole of the sent
      to its reference, by calling
      the reference of a word part of the reference of the sentence,
      if the word itself is a part of the sentence.
  * shall now be put to further test
    * the truth value of a sentence remains unchanged when an expression is
      replaced by another having the same reference: but we have not yet
    * what if the expression to be replaced is itself a sentence. Now if our
    * the truth value of the sentence must remain unchanged
      * Exceptions are to be expected when the whole sentence or its part is
        direct or indirect quotation; for in such cases, as we have seen, the
      * whether the ref of the subordinate sentence is a truth value.
      * Of indirect quotation we already know the opposite (ref is thought)
      * Grammarians divide subordinate clauses into noun clauses, adjective
        clauses, adverbial clauses
      * might generate the supposition that the reference of a subordinate
        clause was not a truth value but rather of the same kind as the part of
      * we shall not follow the grammatical categories strictly, but rather
        group together what is logically of the same kind
      * Let us first search for cases in which the sense of the subordinate
        clause is not an independent thought.
* an abstract noun clause, introduced by `that,`
  * the case of indirect quotation, in which we have seen the
    words to have their indirect reference coinciding with what is customarily sen
    * the subordinate clause has for its
      reference a thought, not a truth value;

    similar words: above

  * say:
    the reference of the subordinate clause is in fact the thought
    can also be recognized by seeing that it is indifferent to the truth of the
    whole whether the subordinate clause is true or false.
  * eg _Copernicus believed that the planetary orbits are circles_ and
       _Copernicus believed that the apparent motion of the sun is produced by
         the real motion of the Earth._
    * One subordinate clause can be substituted for the other without harm to
      the truth. The main clause and the subordinate clause together have as
      their
sense only a single thought, and the truth of the whole includes neither
the truth nor the untruth of the subordinate clause. In such cases it is not
permissible to replace one expression in the subordinate clause by another
having the same customary reference, but only by one having the same indirect
reference, i.e. the same customary sense. If somebody were
to conclude: The reference of a sentence is not its truth value, for in that
case it could always be replaced by another sentence of the same truth
value; he would prove too much; one might just as well claim that the
reference of `morning star` is not Venus, since one may not always say
`Venus` in place of `morning star.` One has the right to conclude only that
the reference of a sentence is not always its truth value, and that _morning
star_ does not always stand for the planet Venus, viz. when the word has
its indirect reference. An exception of such a kind occurs in the subordinate
clause just considered which has a thought as its reference.

If one says `It seems that ...` one means `It seems to me that ...` or `I
think that ...' We therefore have the same case again. The situation is
similar in the case of expressions such as `to be pleased,` `to regret,` `to
approve,' `to blame,` `to hope,` `to fear.` If, toward the end of the battle of
Waterloo, Wellington was glad that the Prussians were coming, the basis
for his joy was a conviction. Had he been deceived, he would have
been no less pleased so long as his illusion lasted; and before he became
so convinced he could not have been pleased that the Prussians
were coming -even though in fact they might have been already approaching.

Just as a conviction or a belief is the ground of a feeling, it can, as in
inference, also be the ground of a conviction. In the sentence: _Columbus
inferred from the roundness of the Earth that he could reach India by
travelling towards the west,_ we have as the reference of the parts two
thoughts, that the Earth is round, and that Columbus by travelling to the
west could reach India. All that is relevant here is that Columbus was
convinced of both, and that the one conviction was a ground for the other.
Whether the Earth is really round and Columbus could really reach India
by travelling west, as he thought, is immaterial to the truth of our sentence;
but it is not immaterial whether we replace `the Earth` by `the planet which
is accompanied by a moon whose diameter is greater than the fourth part
of its own.' Here also we have the indirect reference of the words.

* Adverbial final clauses beginning `in order that` also belong here; for
  * the purpose is a thought; therefore: indirect reference for the words,
    subjunctive mood.

* A subordinate clause with `that` after `command,` `ask,` `forbid,` would
  appear in direct speech as an imperative. Such a clause has
  * no reference but only a sense. A command, a request, are indeed not
  * in such subordinate clauses, words have their indirect reference.
  * The reference of such a clause is therefore not a truth value but a command,
    a request, and so forth.

* similar: dependent question in phrases such as _doubt whether,_ _not to know
  what._ It is easy to see that here also the
  * words are to be taken to have their indirect reference
* Dependent clauses expressing questions and beginning, with `who,` `what,`
  `where,` `when,` `how,` `by what means,` etc., seem at times to
  * approximate very closely to adverbial clauses in which
    words have their customary references. These cases are
  * distinguished linguistically [in German] by the mood of the verb. With the
    * subjunctive, we have a dependent question and indirect reference of the ws
      * so a proper name cannot in general be replaced by another name of the
        same object.

* In the cases so far considered
  the words of the subordinate clauses had their indirect reference, and this
  => reference of the subordinate clause itself was indirect,
  i.e. not a truth value but a thought, a command, a request, a question
  * The subordinate clause could be regarded as a noun, indeed one could say: as
    a proper name of that thought, that command, etc., which it represented in

* We now come to other subordinate clauses, in which the
  words do have their customary reference
  without however a thought occurring as sense and a truth value as reference.
  * eg Whoever discovered the elliptic form of the planetary orbits died in
    misery.
  * If the sense of the subordinate clause were here a thought,
    it would have to be possible to express it also in a separate sentence
  * But this does not work, because
    the grammatical subject `whoever` has no independent sense and only mediates
    => the sense of the subordinate clause is not a complete thought, and its
    reference is Kepler, not a truth value
  * One might object that the sense of the whole does contain [entail] a thought
    as part,
    viz. that there was somebody who first discovered the elliptic form
    * whoever takes the whole to be true cannot deny this part
    * This only because otherwise the dependent clause would have no reference.
  * If anything is asserted there is always an obvious presupposition that the
    simple or compound proper names used have reference
  * there are expressions which fail to designate an object because the truth of
    some sentence is a prerequisite. Thus it depends on the truth of the

There was someone who discovered the elliptic form of the planetary
orbits

whether the subordinate clause

Whoever discovered the elliptic form of the planetary orbits

really designates an object or only seems to do so while having in fact no
reference. And thus it may appear as if our subordinate clause contained as a
part of its sense the thought that there was somebody who discovered the
elliptic form of the planetary orbits. If this were right the negation would
run:

Either whoever discovered the elliptic form of the planetary orbits did
not die in misery or there was nobody who discovered the elliptic form
of the planetary orbits.

This arises from an imperfection of language, from which even the symbolic
language of mathematical analysis is not altogether free; even there
combinations of symbols can occur that seem to stand for something but have (at
least so far) no reference, e.g. divergent infinite series. This can be avoided,
e.g., by means of the special stipulation that divergent infinite series shall
stand for the number 0. A logically perfect language (Begriffsschrift) should
satisfy the conditions, that every expression grammatically well constructed as
a proper name out of signs already introduced shall in fact designate an object,
and that no new sign shall be introduced as a proper name without being secured
a reference. The logic books contain warnings against logical mistakes arising
from the ambiguity of expressions. I regard as no less pertinent a warning
against apparent proper names having no reference. The history of mathematics
supplies errors which have arisen in this way. This lends itself to demagogic
abuse as easily as ambiguity -perhaps more easily. _The will of the people_ can
serve as an example; for it is easy to establish that there is at any rate no
generally accepted reference for this expression. It is therefore by no means
unimportant to eliminate the source of these mistakes, at least in science, once
and for all. Then such objections as the one discussed above would become
impossible, because it could never depend upon the truth of a thought whether a
proper name had a reference.

* consideration of types of adjective and adverbial clauses which are
  * logically in close relation to noun clauses

* Adjective clauses also serve to construct compound proper names, though,
  unlike noun clauses, they are not sufficient by themselves for this purpose.
  * equivalent to adjectives.
    Instead of `the square root of 4 which is smaller than 0,` one can also say
    `the negative square root of 4.` We have here the case of
  * a compound proper name constructed from the expression for a concept with
    the help of the singular definite article
  * permissible if the concept applies to one and only one single object.*

* Expressions for concepts can be so constructed as adjective clauses as, in our
  * cannot have a thought as sense or a truth value as reference, any more than
    the noun clause could. Its sense, which can also be expressed in many cases
    by a single adjective, is only a part of a thought. Here, as in the case of
    the noun clause, there is no independent subject and therefore no
    possibility of reproducing the sense of the subordinate clause in an
    independent sentence.

Places, instants, stretches of time, are, logically considered, objects;
hence the linguistic designation of a definite place, a definite instant, or
a stretch of time is to be regarded as a proper name. Now adverbial
clauses of place and time can be used for the construction of such a
proper name in a manner similar to that which we have seen in the
case of noun and adjective clauses. In the same way, expressions for
concepts bringing in places, etc., can be constructed. It is to be noted
here also that the sense of these subordinate clauses cannot be reproduced in an independent sentence, since an essential component, viz. the
determination of place or time, is missing and is only indicated by a
relative pronoun or a conjunction.y

In conditional clauses, also, there may usually be recognized to occur
an indefinite indicator, having a similar correlate in the dependent clause.
(We have already seen this occur in noun, adjective, and adverbial
* In accordance with what was said above, an expression of the kind in question must
actually always be assured of reference, by means of a special stipulation, e.g. by the
convention that 0 shall count as its reference, when the concept applies to no object or to
more than one.
y In the case of these sentences, various interpretations are easily possible. The sense of the
sentence, _After Schleswig-Holstein was separated from Denmark, Prussia and Austria
quarrelled_ can also be rendered in the form _After the separation of Schleswig-Holstein_




clauses.) In so far as each indicator refers to the other, both clauses
together form a connected whole, which as a rule expresses only a single
thought. In the sentence

If a number is less than 1 and greater than 0, its square is less than 1 and
greater than 0
the component in question is `a number` in the conditional clause and `its`
in the dependent clause. It is by means of this very indefiniteness that the
sense acquires the generality expected of a law. It is this which is responsible for the fact that the antecedent clause alone has no complete thought
as its sense and in combination with the consequent clause expresses one
and only one thought, whose parts are no longer thoughts. It is, in
general, incorrect to say that in the hypothetical judgment two judgments
are put in reciprocal relationship. If this or something similar is said, the
word `judgment` is used in the same sense as I have connected with the
word `thought,` so that I would use the formulation: `A hypothetical
thought establishes a reciprocal relationship between two thoughts.'

This could be true only if an indefinite indicator is absent;* but in such
a case there would also be no generality.

If an instant of time is to be indefinitely indicated in both conditional
and dependent clauses, this is often achieved merely by using the present
tense of the verb, which in such a case however does not indicate the
temporal present. This grammatical form is then the indefinite indicator
in the main and subordinate clauses. An example of this is: _When the
Sun is in the tropic of Cancer, the longest day in the northern hemisphere
from Denmark, Prussia and Austria quarrelled._ In this version, it is surely sufficiently clear
that the sense is not to be taken as having as a part the thought that Schleswig-Holstein was
once separated from Denmark, but that this is the necessary presupposition in order for the
expression `after the separation of Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark` to have any reference
at all. To be sure, our sentence can also be interpreted as saying that Schleswig-Holstein was
once separated from Denmark. We then have a case which is to be considered later. In order
to understand the difference more clearly, let us project ourselves into the mind of a Chinese
who, having little knowledge of European history, believes it to be false that SchleswigHolstein was ever separated from Denmark. He will take our sentence, in the first version, to
be neither true nor false but will deny it to have any reference, on the ground of absence of
reference for its subordinate clause. This clause would only apparently determine a time. If
he interpreted our sentence in the second way, however, he would find a thought expressed
in it which he would take to be false, beside a part which would be without reference for
him.
* At times an explicit linguistic indication is missing and must be read off from the entire
context.

occurs.' Here, also, it is impossible to express the sense of the subordinate
clause in a full sentence, because this sense is not a complete thought. If
we say: `The Sun is in the tropic of Cancer,` this would refer to our
present time and thereby change the sense. Just as little is the sense of
the main clause a thought; only the whole, composed of main and
subordinate clauses, has such a sense. It may be added that several
common components in the antecedent and consequent clauses may be
indefinitely indicated.

It is clear that noun clauses with `who` or `what` and adverbial clauses
with `where,` `when,` `wherever,` `whenever` are often to be interpreted
as having the sense of conditional clauses, e.g. _who touches pitch, defiles himself._

Adjective clauses can also take the place of conditional clauses. Thus the
sense of the sentence previously used can be given in the form _The square of a
number which is less than 1 and greater than 0 is less than 1 and greater than
0._

The situation is quite different if the common component of the two
clauses is designated by a proper name. In the sentence:

Napoleon, who recognized the danger to his right flank, himself led his
guards against the enemy position
two thoughts are expressed:
1
2


Napoleon recognized the danger to his right flank

Napoleon himself led his guards against the enemy position.


When and where this happened is to be fixed only by the context, but is
nevertheless to be taken as definitely determined thereby. If the entire
sentence is uttered as an assertion, we thereby simultaneously assert both
component sentences. If one of the parts is false, the whole is false. Here
we have the case that the subordinate clause by itself has a complete
thought as sense (if we complete it by indication of place and time). The
reference of the subordinate clause is accordingly a truth value. We can
therefore expect that it may be replaced, without harm to the truth value
of the whole, by a sentence having the same truth value. This is indeed
the case; but it is to be noticed that for purely grammatical reasons, its
subject must be `Napoleon,` for only then can it be brought into the form
of an adjective clause belonging to `Napoleon.` But if the demand that it
be expressed in this form be waived, and the connexion be shown by
`and,` this restriction disappears.

Subsidiary clauses beginning with `although` also express complete
thoughts. This conjunction actually has no sense and does not change
the sense of the clause but only illuminates it in a peculiar fashion.* We
could indeed replace the concessive clause without harm to the truth of
the whole by another of the same truth value; but the light in which the
clause is placed by the conjunction might then easily appear unsuitable,
as if a song with a sad subject were to be sung in a lively fashion.

In the last cases the truth of the whole included the truth of the
component clauses. The case is different if a conditional clause expresses
a complete thought by containing, in place of an indefinite indicator, a
proper name or something which is to be regarded as equivalent. In the
sentence

If the Sun has already risen, the sky is very cloudy
the time is the present, that is to say, definite. And the place is also to be
thought of as definite. Here it can be said that a relation between the truth
values of conditional and dependent clauses has been asserted, viz. such
that the case does not occur in which the antecedent stands for the True
and the consequent for the False. Accordingly, our sentence is true if the

Sun has not yet risen, whether the sky is very cloudy or not, and also if
the Sun has risen and the sky is very cloudy. Since only truth values are
here in question, each component clause can be replaced by another of
the same truth value without changing the truth value of the whole. To be
sure, the light in which the subject then appears would usually be
unsuitable; the thought might easily seem distorted; but this has nothing
to do with its truth value. One must always take care not to clash with the
subsidiary thoughts, which are however not explicitly expressed and
therefore should not be reckoned in the sense. Hence, also, no account
need be taken of their truth values.y

The simple cases have now been discussed. Let us review what we
have learned.

The subordinate clause usually has for its sense not a thought, but only
a part of one, and consequently no truth value as reference. The reason
for this is either that the words in the subordinate clause have indirect
reference, so that the reference, not the sense, of the subordinate clause is
* Similarly in the case of `but,` `yet.`
y

The thought of our sentence might also be expressed thus: _Either the Sun has
not risen yet or the sky is very cloudy_ -which shows how this kind of sentence
connexion is to be understood.

=On Sense and Reference

a thought; or else that, on account of the presence of an indefinite
indicator, the subordinate clause is incomplete and expresses a thought
only when combined with the main clause. It may happen, however, that
the sense of the subsidiary clause is a complete thought, in which case it
can be replaced by another of the same truth value without harm to the
truth of the whole -provided there are no grammatical obstacles.

An examination of all the subordinate clauses which one may encounter
will soon provide some which do not fit well into these categories. The
reason, so far as I can see, is that these subordinate clauses have no such
simple sense. Almost always, it seems, we connect with the main thoughts
expressed by us subsidiary thoughts which, although not expressed, are
associated with our words, in accordance with psychological laws, by the
hearer. And since the subsidiary thought appears to be connected with our
words of its own accord, almost like the main thought itself, we want it also
to be expressed. The sense of the sentence is thereby enriched, and it may
well happen that we have more simple thoughts than clauses. In many
cases the sentence must be understood in this way, in others it may be
doubtful whether the subsidiary thought belongs to the sense of the
sentence or only accompanies it.* One might perhaps find that the sentence

Napoleon, who recognized the danger to his right flank, himself led his
guards against the enemy position
expresses not only the two thoughts shown above, but also the thought
that the knowledge of the danger was the reason why he led the guards
against the enemy position. One may in fact doubt whether this thought
is merely slightly suggested or really expressed. Let the question be
considered whether our sentence be false if Napoleon's decision had
already been made before he recognized the danger. If our sentence
could be true in spite of this, the subsidiary thought should not be
understood as part of the sense. One would probably decide in favour
of this. The alternative would make for a quite complicated situation: We
would have more simple thoughts than clauses. If the sentence

Napoleon recognized the danger to his right flank
were now to be replaced by another having the same truth value, e.g.

Napoleon was already more than 45 years old
* This may be important for the question whether an assertion is a lie, or an oath a perjury.

not only would our first thought be changed, but also our third one.

Hence the truth value of the latter might change -viz. if his age was not
the reason for the decision to lead the guards against the enemy. This
shows why clauses of equal truth value cannot always be substituted for
one another in such cases. The clause expresses more through its connexion with another than it does in isolation.

Let us now consider cases where this regularly happens. In the
sentence:

Bebel fancies that the return of Alsace-Lorraine would appease

France's desire for revenge
two thoughts are expressed, which are not however shown by means of
antecedent and consequent clauses, viz.:
(1)
(2)


Bebel believes that the return of Alsace-Lorraine would appease

France's desire for revenge
the return of Alsace-Lorraine would not appease France's desire
for revenge.


In the expression of the first thought, the words of the subordinate clause
have their indirect reference, while the same words have their customary
reference in the expression of the second thought. This shows that the
subordinate clause in our original complex sentence is to be taken twice
over, with different reference, standing once for a thought, once for a
truth value. Since the truth value is not the whole reference of the subordinate clause, we cannot simply replace the latter by another of equal
truth value. Similar considerations apply to expressions such as `know,`
`discover,` `it is known that.`

By means of a subordinate causal clause and the associated main clause we
express several thoughts, which however do not correspond separately to the
original clauses. In the sentence: _Because ice is less dense than water, it
floats on water_ we have
(1) Ice is less dense than water;
(2) If anything is less dense than water, it floats on water;
(3) Ice floats on water.






The third thought, however, need not be explicitly introduced, since it is
contained in the remaining two. On the other hand, neither the first and
third nor the second and third combined would furnish the sense of our
sentence. It can now be seen that our subordinate clause

=On Sense and Reference

55

because ice is less dense than water
expresses our first thought, as well as a part of our second. This is how it
comes to pass that our subsidiary clause cannot be simply replaced by
another of equal truth value; for this would alter our second thought and
thereby might well alter its truth value.

The situation is similar in the sentence

If iron were less dense than water, it would float on water.

Here we have the two thoughts that iron is not less dense than water,
and that something floats on water if it is less dense than water. The
subsidiary clause again expresses one thought and a part of the other.

If we interpret the sentence already considered

After Schleswig-Holstein was separated from Denmark, Prussia and

Austria quarrelled
in such a way that it expresses the thought that Schleswig-Holstein was
once separated from Denmark, we have first this thought, and secondly
the thought that at a time, more closely determined by the subordinate
clause, Prussia and Austria quarrelled. Here also the subordinate clause
expresses not only one thought but also a part of another. Therefore it
may not in general be replaced by another of the same truth value.

It is hard to exhaust all the possibilities given by language; but I hope to
have brought to light at least the essential reasons why a subordinate
clause may not always be replaced by another of equal truth value
without harm to the truth of the whole sentence structure. These reasons
arise:
(1)
(2)

when the subordinate clause does not stand for a truth value,
inasmuch as it expresses only a part of a thought;
when the subordinate clause does stand for a truth value but is not
restricted to so doing, inasmuch as its sense includes one thought
and part of another.


The first case arises:
(a) in indirect reference of words
(b) if a part of the sentence is only an indefinite indicator instead of a
proper name.

Gottlob Frege


In the second case, the subsidiary clause may have to be taken twice over,
viz. once in its customary reference, and the other time in indirect reference; or the sense of a part of the subordinate clause may likewise be a
component of another thought, which, taken together with the thought
directly expressed by the subordinate clause, makes up the sense of the
whole sentence.

It follows with sufficient probability from the foregoing that the cases
where a subordinate clause is not replaceable by another of the same
value cannot be brought in disproof of our view that a truth value is the
reference of a sentence having a thought as its sense.

Let us return to our starting point.

When we found `a = a` and `a = b` to have different cognitive values,
the explanation is that for the purpose of knowledge, the sense of the
sentence, viz., the thought expressed by it, is no less relevant than its
reference, i.e. its truth value. If now a = b, then indeed the reference of `b`
is the same as that of `a,` and hence the truth value of `a = b` is the same as
that of `a = a.` In spite of this, the sense of `b` may differ from that of `a`,
and thereby the thought expressed in `a = b` differs from that of `a = a.`

In that case the two sentences do not have the same cognitive value. If we
understand by `judgment` the advance from the thought to its truth
value, as in the above paper, we can also say that the judgments are
different.
