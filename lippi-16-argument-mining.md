2016 ACM Transactions on Internet Technology

* efforts made under the general umbrella of argumentation mining in fact aim
  * a constellation of sub-tasks, whereas a
  * single unifying view is still missing.
  * We thus aim to propose one such view + discuss challenges and perspectives
* This study is organized as follows. In
   2. introduce argumentation models found in the literature
   3. general architecture for argumentation mining systems, identifying
    * common (and uncommon) tasks and sub-tasks, and we critically discuss the
    * main techniques used to address them, their
      * shortcomings, and possible ways to advance the state of the art.
   4. describes corpora and applications.  These two are closely related, since
      * different domains, and for each of them a number of domain-related
   5. a subjective perspective on the major challenges that lie ahead.
   6. concludes with a look to future applications.

# 2. ARGUMENTATION MODELS

* related tasks, such as
  * rhetorical characterization of sentences [Houngbo and Mercer 2014],
  * opinionated claim analysis [Rosenthal and McKeown 2012],
  * premise verification [Park and Cardie 2014], etc. In this survey, we mainly
  * briefly surveyed in Section 4 (see Table IV).
    * Opinionated claim mining [Rosenthal and McKeown 2012]
    * Argumentative opinion analysis [Villalba and Saint-Dizier 2012]
    * Argument scheme classification [Feng and Hirst 2011]

# 4

* opinionated claim mining [Rosenthal and McKeown 2012], a problem that is
  * closer to sentiment analysis, where the aim is to
  * detect assertions containing some belief,
    of whose truth a user is attempting to convince an audience;
