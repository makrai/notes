* Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, to manage distress
  * Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and
  * complex and difficult to reliably measure,
    particularly in clinical dialogues
* We:
  * PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances
    labeled for defense level, and
    * 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with
    * Cohen's kappa 0.639
  * DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline: evidence-based pre-annotations
    * In a counter-balanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by
      22.4%
    * In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical
      plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale
    * strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate
      clear headroom, with the
      * best macro F1-score around 30% and a
      * tendency to overpredict mature defenses
* Corpus analyses
  * confirm that mature defenses are most common and
  * reveal emotion-specific deviations
* We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research
