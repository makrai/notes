A Sketch of Late Zhou Chinese Grammar
Derek Herforth
CHAPTER FOUR

# 1 INTRODUCTION

* Chinese = Sinitic langs genetically related to the Tibeto-Burman (TB) family
  * Sino-Tibetan (ST) hypothesis
  * phonological and semantic correspondences between the basic word-stocks and
    reconstructed morphological systems of
    Old Chinese (thirteenth century BCE–third century CE) and
    TB languages, especially the earliest attested of these, Old Tibetan
    (eighth century) and Old Burmese (twelfth century)
  * bib
    * ST lexicon: Norman (1988: 12–16) and Baxter (1995) for ST lexicon, and
    * morphology: Norman (1988: 84–7) and Baxter and Sagart (1998) for
* morphology so far reconstructed for Old Chinese (OC) is exclusly derivational
  * some evidence of regular phonological alternations that derive
    * nouns from verbs (*bə nh ‘a share’ from *pə n ‘to divide’), or
      transitives from intransitives (*kinh ‘to see’ from *ginh ‘to appear’),
  * no traces have been found of subsyllabic markers of tense, number (singular
    vs plural) or core participant relations (subject vs direct object, etc)
  * neither morphology nor case particles => strict word order within the clause
  * <=> Cf Latin or Japanese, where the phrase-internal marking of subject and
    object by case endings/particles permits greater freedom of ordering
