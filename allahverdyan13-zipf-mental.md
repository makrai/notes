# Abstract

* Zipf’s law is
  * the major regularity of statistical linguistics that served as
  * a prototype for rank-frequency relations and scaling laws in natural
    sciences

# Preliminary summary 3

13. The basic reason for the words to have ... (variable) probabilities is that
  * author should be able to compose different texts,
    where the same word can have very different frequencies [see I].  Hence
  * P(θ) relates to the prior knowledge (or lexicon) of the author on words
  * This concept of mental lexicon is an established one in psycholinguistics
