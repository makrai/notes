# Abstract

* we introduce an 
  * edge probing task design and construct 
  * a broad suite of sub-sentence tasks derived from the traditional structured
    NLP pipeline. 
* We probe word-level contextual representations from four recent models and
* syntactic, semantic, local, and long-range phenomena. We find that existing
* strong representations for syntactic phenomena, but only offer comparably
  small improvements on semantic tasks over a non-contextual baseline.
