(Submitted on 20 Apr 2018 (v1), last revised 5 Sep 2018 (this version, v3))

# Abstract

* word representations learned separately on distinct languages can be aligned
* Existing works typically solve a
  * least-square regression problem to learn a rotation aligning a small lex
  * retrieval criterion for inference.
* In this paper, we propose an unified formulation that directly optimizes a
  * biggest improvements observed for distant language pairs such as en-Chinese
