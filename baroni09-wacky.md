* the relative benefits of web-derived vs. traditional corpora
  * a large literature on the issue (see Section 2 below for some references),
    and our group has expressed its own view in several other locations –
    see for example Section 2 of Baroni and Ueyama (2006) and Chapter 1 of
    Ferraresi (2007)

  * publicly available in 2006 (Brants and Franz, 2006)
* CUCWeb (Boleda+ 2006) is a Catalan corpus containing 166 M words
  * from a crawl seeded with a URL list provided by a search engine
* Sharoff developed a collection of ‘BNC-sized’ corpora (around 100 M tokens)
  * as of early 2008, include English, Chinese, Finnish, French, German,
    Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish,
* there are initiatives that cover
  * more languages (Sharoff, 2006), web corpora with
  * more in-depth linguistic annotation (Boleda+ 2006), and many
  * larger web-derived resources 
    (Clarke+ 2005; Liu and Curran, 2006; Shaoul and Westbury, 2007)
* the WaCky collection offers a compromise between
  * very large size
    * the corpora by Sharoff and Boleda+ are about one tenth the size of the
      WaCky corpora
  * thorough post-processing for linguistic purposes
    * neither Shaoul and Westbury nor the other developers of mega-corpora had
      corpus balance, cleaning or linguistic annotation among their priorities
