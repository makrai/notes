#Abstract

* We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernymâ€“hyponym relation by
using the word-embedding-based semantic projections
* Our result ... outperforms the state-of-theart methods
* combining our method with a previous ... hierarchy extension method can
  further improve F- score to 80.29%
