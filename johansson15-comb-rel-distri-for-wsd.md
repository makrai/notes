#Abstract

* input to the algorithm is a 
  * large unlabeled corpus and a 
  * graph describing how senses are related; 
  * no annotated corpus is needed
* We evaluated the new word sense disambiguation system on two Swedish test
  sets annotated with senses defined by the SALDO lexical resource
  * accuracy was close to that of a state-of-the-art graph-based system 
  * computationally much more efficient
