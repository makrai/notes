# Abstract

* Phonological and orthographic constraints on sem activation in readi Chinese
  * phonologically mediated semantic priming technique.
 * experiments
   1. we observed no significant mediated priming and homophone density effects
      for homophone mediated primes having no orthographic similarity with
      semantic primes
  2. Such primes, when they contained regular phonetic radicals, did produce
     significant effects
  3. targets were facilitated to the same extent by mediated primes that were
     either orthographically similar and homophonic to or only orthographically
     similar to semantic primes
   4. facilitatory effects equivalent to semantic priming were observed for
      orthographically similar homophone mediated primes containing regular and
      consistent phonetic radicals
* We argue that access to semantics in reading Chinese is constrained by both
  phonology and orthography operating in interaction with each other, and that
  * phonology has no inherently privileged role over orthography in
    constraining semantic activation
