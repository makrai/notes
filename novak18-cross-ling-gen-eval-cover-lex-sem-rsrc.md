# Abstract

* word embeddings and interpretability
* we present the Thing Recognizer
  * a method that assigns explicit symbolic semantic features
    from a finite list of terms to words present in an embedding model
  * making the model interpretable for humans and covering the semantic space
    by a controlled vocabulary of semantic features
  * in a cross-lingual manner:
  * semantic tags form lexical resources in English to the Hungarian embedding

# 3 Word Embedding Models for Morphologically Rich Languages

* full morphological disambiguation was applied to the input words, and the
  tag sequence following the main PoS tag of each word was detached and
  included as a separate token following the token consisting of the lemma and
  the PoS tag in the text. The following example shows the representation of
  the sentence Szeretlek, kedvesem. ‘I love you, dear.’:

# 4 Lexical Resources

* The third resource we used, 4lang
