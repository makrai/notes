# Abstract

* NarrCat: The Narrative Categorical Content Analysis toolkit 
  * decomposes narratives into distinct, quantifiable psychological processes.
* we: NarrCat was applied to analyze New Zealand’s historical “Speeches from
  the Throne” from 1854 to 1913 (68 speeches). Specifically, 
  * NarrCat’s cognition, emotion, and intention modules were applied to analyze
    patterns of psychological perspective, or psychological states, 
    attributed to various groups in the speeches 
    (Māori, British settlers, and British governing elites). This allowed us to
  * infrahumanization bias, as denoted by patterns of language, in New
    Zealand’s governing discourses during colonization. Results showed that
    * Māori were infrahumanized compared with the British settlers overall.
    * However, only British Governing elites were attributed significantly
      greater agency (i.e., cognition and intention) in inferences of their
      psychological perspective compared with other groups.
  * Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed through the lens
    of infrahumanization theory, as well as colonizing discourses like the
    British Enlightenment and Good Māori–Bad Māori discourse.

# Narrative Categorical Content Analysis

* theories and technology for the quantitative analysis of texts
  * Recent decades have witnessed an explosive advance in both 
  * Popping, 1997; Smith, Atkinson, McClelland, & Veroff, 1992; West, 2001
  * NarrCat
    * Relatively new among these, the NarrCat program is a computerized
    * quantitatively analyze narrative composition, in relation to
      psychological processes within texts (László+ 2013). In the present
    * psychological perspective refers to a range of psychological states,
      including cognitions, emotions, and intentions, which are
      attributed to actors and groups throughout the texts. Through this, the
* Scientific Narrative Psychology is an empirical approach, proposing that
  narrative composition is a rich source of information on identity-related
  psychological processes (László, 2008; László & Ehmann, 2014). This
  * quantitative analytical methods into the study of identity within text
    (László, Ehmann, Pólya, & Péley, 2007). NarrCat provides the methodological
* NarrCat: psychothematic modules that search texts for specific words and expressions
  (i.e., sequences of words) that match those listed in their built-in dicts
  * filters based on the context of these words and expressions (cf sec Method)
  * Each module identifies linguistic markers of a specific narrative category,
    which each relate to distinct psychological processes involved in
    identity–construction (László & Ehmann, 2014). These 
  * categories include cognition, emotion, and intention, among others (for a
    comprehensive review, see László+ 2013)
  * Output enable researchers to assess  eg
    * which individual or group actors are presented as more or less
      agentic/positive than other actors, more
    * whose psychological perspective is presented more in a text

## Comparison With LIWC

* the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker, Francis, & Booth, 2001)
  * word categories in texts that are relevant to psychological phenomena and
  * language use ~> personality, coping styles and social behavior
    (Chung & Pennebaker, 2012; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)
* both LIWC and NarrCat are automatized content analytical devices
* LIWC typically focuses on correlations between word choices in a text and
  the psychological states of the writer (or reader) measured outside the
  text (Pennebaker & King, 1999; Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003;
  Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010), 
* NarrCat: how narrative composition constructs psychological meaning by
  assessing theory-driven psychological processes within the text.1
  * particularly phenomena unfolding over time
    (Archer, 1996; Liu, Fisher-Onar, & Woodward, 2014), as it can open a
  * psychological phenomena taking place in the past through historical records
* the output data yielded by NarrCat and LIWC are similar. 
  * Both tools count the number of hits in their respective categories. That
  * NarrCat: how many times a text describes the emotions, cognitions, and
    intentions of an actor/group or narrator
    (among other categories relevant to identity–construction)

## Past Applications

* social psychological processes underlying the construction and transmission
  of Hungary’s national identity. Specifically, a narrative of Hungarian
  * collective victimhood (see Vollhardt, 2012, for a theoretical overview) was
  * the agency module of NarrCat was applied to history textbooks to measure
    frequencies of agentic words and phrases attributed to the Hungarian
    in-group and relevant out-group countries.
    * Hungary was attributed relatively less agency than other countries 
      (László, Ferenczhalmy, & Szalai, 2010).
  * Another study applied the emotion module to similar texts, and a collective
    * depressive feelings characterized historical self-representations, while
      hostile emotions characterized the depiction of out-group (Fülöp+ 2013)
* only to explore the group identity structure of Hungarians
  * with Hungarian dictionaries for the analysis (László & Ehmann, 2014;
    László+ 2010; Vincze, Ilg, & Pólya, 2014; Vincze & László, 2004)
