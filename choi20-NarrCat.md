# Abstract

* NarrCat: The Narrative Categorical Content Analysis toolkit
  * decomposes narratives into distinct, quantifiable psychological processes
* we apply NarrCat to analyze New Zealand’s historical “Speeches from the
  Throne” from 1854 to 1913 (68 speeches)
  * NarrCat’s cognition, emotion, and intention modules were applied to analyze
    patterns of psychological perspective, or psychological states,
    attributed to various groups in the speeches
    (Māori, British settlers, and British governing elites)
  * infrahumanization bias, as denoted by patterns of language, in New
    Zealand’s governing discourses during colonization
    * Māori were infrahumanized compared with the British settlers overall
    * only British Governing elites were attributed signif greater agency
      (ie cognition and intention) in inferences of their psycho perspective
      compared with other groups
  * Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed through the lens
    of infrahumanization theory, as well as colonizing discourses like the
    British Enlightenment and Good Māori–Bad Māori discourse

---

* we contribute to the social science literature in two ways
  * methodological: NarrCat as an effective textual analysis tool,
    specifically in analyzing intergroup phenomena
  * theoretical contribution by refining
    * intergroup theory (infrahumanization centered on elitism) in application
      to a specific historical context that nevertheless has significant
* organization
  * the central assumptions of our methodological orientation before reviewing
  * the theoretical framework we seek to advance, alongside the
  * historical context relevant to our analysis

# Narrative Categorical Content Analysis

* theories and technology for the quantitative analysis of texts
  * Recent decades have witnessed an explosive advance in both
  * Popping, 1997; Smith, Atkinson, McClelland, & Veroff, 1992; West, 2001
  * NarrCat
    * Relatively new among these
    * quantitatively analyze narrative composition, in relation to
      psychological processes within texts (László+ 2013)
    * psychological perspective refers to a range of psychological states,
      including cognitions, emotions, and intentions, which are
      attributed to actors and groups throughout the texts
* Scientific Narrative Psychology is an empirical approach, proposing that
  narrative composition is a rich source of information on identity-related
  psychological processes (László, 2008; László & Ehmann, 2014)
  * quantitative analytical methods into the study of identity within text
    (László, Ehmann, Pólya, & Péley, 2007). NarrCat provides the method
* NarrCat: psychothematic modules that
  search texts for specific words and expressions (ie sequences of words) that
  match those listed in their built-in dictionaries
  * filters based on the context of these words and expressions (cf sec Method)
  * Each module identifies linguistic markers of a specific narrative category,
    which each relate to distinct psychological processes involved in
    identity–construction (László & Ehmann, 2014)
  * categories include cognition, emotion, and intention, among others
    * comprehensive review: László+ (2013)
  * Output enables researchers to assess eg
    * which individual or group actors are presented as more agentic/positive
      than other actors
    * whose psychological perspective is presented more in a text

## Comparison With LIWC

* the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker, Francis, & Booth, 2001)
  * word categories in texts that are relevant to psychological phenomena and
  * language use ~> personality, coping styles and social behavior
    (Chung & Pennebaker, 2012; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)
* both LIWC and NarrCat are automatized content analytical devices
* LIWC typically focuses on correlations between word choices in a text and
  the psychological states of the writer (or reader) measured outside the
  text (Pennebaker & King, 1999; Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003;
  Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)
* NarrCat: how narrative composition constructs psychological meaning 
  * theory-driven
  * particularly phenomena unfolding over time
    (Archer, 1996; Liu, Fisher-Onar, & Woodward, 2014)
  * psychological phenomena taking place in the past <~ historical records
* the output data yielded by NarrCat and LIWC are similar
  * Both tools count the number of hits in their respective categories
  * NarrCat: how many times a text describes the emotions, cognitions, and
    intentions of an actor/group or narrator
    (among other categories relevant to identity–construction)

## Past Applications

* social psychological processes underlying the construction and transmission
  of Hungary’s national identity. Specifically, a narrative
  * collective victimhood (see Vollhardt, 2012, for a theoretical overview) was
  * the agency module of NarrCat was applied to history textbooks to measure
    frequencies of agentic words and phrases attributed to the Hungarian
    in-group and relevant out-group countries
    * Hungary was attributed relatively less agency than other countries
      (László, Ferenczhalmy, & Szalai, 2010)
  * Another study applied the emotion module to similar texts
    * depressive feelings characterized historical self-representations, while
    * hostile emotions characterized the depiction of out-group (Fülöp+ 2013)
* only to explore the group identity structure of Hungarians
  * with Hungarian dictionaries for the analysis (László & Ehmann, 2014;
    László+ 2010; Vincze, Ilg, & Pólya, 2014; Vincze & László, 2004)

# Method

* Search words: prevalent terms and labels referring to ... as a group or indiv
  * Māori  (Māori, native aborigine, chief, tribe, and iwi),
  * settlers as a group or individuals (colonist, settler, British, Colonial,
    European, English, our race, founders, and Pākehā), 
  * symbols of the colony’s founding treaty between Māori and settlers
    (Waitangi and Treaty) and 
  * general inter-group terminologies (race and ethnicity). 
* The contexts of each returned word and word stem were reviewed to confirm the
  * eg “chief” were included only when referring to a Māori chief, and extracts
  * “British” were included only when referring to British settlers in NZ
* length of each extract was determined by representation of a single topical
  discursive unit. This process resulted in a total of 
  * 218 extracts, with a range from 
  * 0 to 16 extracts identified in any single speech (M = 3.3, SD = 3). The
  * length of individual extracts ranged
    from a single sentence to several paragraphs 
    (8-551 words, M = 142.5, SD = 102.4)

## Analysis by NarrCat

* the English versions of the emotion, cognition, and intention modules of
  NarrCat were used
  * we combined matches from these modules, which were
    all implemented in the NooJ Linguistic Development Environment
    (Silberztein, 2004)
* The Hungarian dictionaries of NarrCat were 
  * The English version of NarrCat’s dictionaries are based on it
  * compiled from frequency dictionaries of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and
    noninflected words, each containing 10,000 of the most frequently used
  * Selection of each entry into their respective NarrCat dictionaries was
    based on at least six independent judges’ consensus. These were
  * subsequently translated into English.
    Dictionaries of the three English NarrCat modules used in the current
  * contain a total of 1,211 words, out of which 147 are disambiguated, and
    they contain a total of 461 phrases.
* Figure 1. Local grammar for the exclusion of certain word sequences from hits
  * This local grammar has two pathways
    * upper pathway recognizes a true hit for the emotion module. The 
    * lower pathway does not recognize a hit and excludes the word from the
    * <WF> is a substitute for any word form 
* linguistic analysis determined the lemma and part of speech category for each
  * Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit (Manning+ 2014).
* each lemmatized word form in the texts were checked against the lemmas listed
  in the built-in dictionaries of the emotion, cognition, and intention
* the grammatical contexts of each match were analyzed using local grammars.
  * The Emotion dictionary contains the word “respect” and a reliable
    contextual cue indicating a false hit is the preposition “in” occurring
    within a sequence of two words preceding the word “respect” (eg in respect
    [to/of], in this respect, in several respects).
  * All occurrences of “respect” meeting this contextual criterion are excluded
  * eg2  “come-to-the-conclusion” also has a context in which cognitive process

  * The part of speech category can also be incorporated in local grammars. For
* number of hits
  * The dictionaries of the cognition, emotion, and intention modules without
    local grammars found 404, 519, and 589 hits, respectively
  * By adding local grammars, the number of hits decreased to 276, 337, and 56,
* each module
  * cognition: words and expressions that infer various cognitive states and
    processes of actors and the narrator in our texts. These
    * mental verbs (eg think, remember), nouns (eg inference, knowledge), idioms
      (eg draw lesson), and more complex linguistic structures describing mental
      operations. The module also identifies verbs and nouns that describe
    * auditory (eg hear, listen) and visual perception (eg view, set eyes on) as
  * emotion: words and expressions referring to the emotionality of actors and
    the narrator in the texts.
    * verbs (eg hope, hurt), nouns (eg fear, fury), adjectives (eg grateful,
      happy), and idioms (eg keen on) relating to emotional states. An example
  * intention: descriptions of behavioral intentions of actors.  These include
    * intentional auxiliary verbs (eg must, have to), intentional nouns (eg
    intention, want), adverbs (eg deliberately, tactically), and expressions
    (eg as a matter of courtesy). An example of an intention hit: “My
