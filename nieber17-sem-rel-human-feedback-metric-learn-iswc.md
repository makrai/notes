Ruder: Injecting additional prior knowledge into word embeddings 
such as word similarity 

#Abstract

* Assessing the degree of semantic relatedness between words
* applications, such as ontology learning for the Semantic Web, semantic search
  or query expansion. To accomplish this in an automated fashion, many
* we propose to utilize a metric learning approach 
  to improve existing semantic relatedness measures 
  by learning from ... [WordSim-353]. For this, we argue to 
* use word embeddings instead of traditional high-dimensional vectors
* test our approach on several domains including 
  tagging data, ?, and navigation
