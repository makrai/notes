# Abstract

* Multi-modal sarcasm detection (MSD) identifies sarcasm and accurately
  understands usersâ€™ real attitudes from text-image pairs. 
* Most MSD researches explore the incongruity of text-image pairs as sarcasm
  * hE these methods blur incongruity information under their global feature
    aggregation mechanisms, leading to incongruity distortions and model
    misinterpretations. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a
* we: incongruity-aware tension field network (ITFNet) for multi-modal sarcasm
  * effective text-image feature pairs in fact and sentiment perspectives. It
  * a fact/sentiment tension field with discrepancy metrics
    to capture the contextual tone and polarized incongruity after the
    iterative learning of tension intensity, effectively highlighting
    incongruity information during such inconsistency preference learning. It
  * standardizes the polarized incongruity with reference to contextual tone
    to obtain standardized incongruity, effectively implementing instance
    standardization for unbiased decision-making in MSD.
    ITFNet performs well in extracting salient and standardized incongruity
    through an incongruity-aware tension field, significantly tackling
    incongruity distortions and cross-instance variance. Moreover, ITFNet
  * SOTA performance surpassing LLaVA1.5-7B with only 17.3M trainable
    parameters, demonstrating its optimal performance-efficiency in
    multi-modal sarcasm detection tasks.
