Journal of Environmental Psychology 60, 112-115

# 1 Intro

* Psychological adaptation to isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environs
  * a multifaceted field of research (Kanas & Manzey, 2008)
  * four large groups of characteristics (Palinkas 2003):
    seasonal, situational, social and salutogenic
    * salutogenic an approach to wellness focusing on health and not on disease
  * main factors involve the length of isolation, occurrence of significant
    events, contact with outsiders, weather; and novices vs veteran
    (Steel and Suedfeld, 1991)
  * individual personality characteristics and adequate coping strategies
    also play an important role (Palinkas, Suedfeld, and Steel 1995)
  * emotional stability, psychological well-being, which includes
    mood and morale, anxiety, depression, aggression, hostility,
    life satisfaction, positive psychological outcomes, etc
  * Settings, crew sizes, and methodologies of emotionality assessment vary
    * summary: Palinkas & Suedfeld (2008)

## 1.1. Patterns of emotionality in ICE environments

* overall decline of mood in the middle or in the second half of the isolation
  (Bechtel & Ledbetter, 1976)
  * sleep difficulties, bad mood, and irritability were considerably higher
    during the mid-winter period (Gunderson and Nelson 1963)
  * three-stage model (Rohrer 1961)
  * Gunderson (1973) also found three distinct phases
* In an early empirical study in Antarctica, Palmai (1963)
  * year divided into four segments and found that
  * The third-quarter saw some further decline in morale,
    reflected also in irritability of the more responsible members
  * Earls (1969) also described a four-quarter general adjustment pattern
    in submarine crews
* In 1991, Bechtel and Berning coined the term “third-quarter phenomenon,”
  though, originally only “for the sake of convenience”
  * empirical support of the model: Harrison & Connors 84,
    Stuster, Bachelard, & Suedfeld 00, Sandal 00, and Décamps & Rosnet 05
  * hE, Steel and Suedfeld found no evidence of this pattern of emotionality
    (Steel, 2001; Steel & Suedfeld, 1991)

## 1.2. Content analysis in the investigation of groups in ICE

* psychological content analysis
* verbal behavior may reflect psychological states and processes
  decodable by linguistic markers
* an established method in polar and space research
* analysis of crew communication with Mission Control
  * interpersonal and individual psychodynamics within the crew
    in both ground-based simulations and space settings
  * review: Gushin+ (2016)
* thematic analysis of space personnel memoirs and crew diaries
  (Suedfeld & Weiszbeck, 2004; Suedfeld, 2006; Johnson+ 2012)
* word-based content analysis, was applied to
  daily diaries of the members of a two-week mission located
  in the Mars Desert Research Station, USA (Ehmann+ 2011)

## 1.3. Aim of the study

* word-based content analysis for exploring and comparing the
  effect of time on overall and fine-grained patterns of emotionality
  * two different winterovering settings in the Antarctica,
    * Concordia and Halley VI
  * assessed the presence of the third-quarter phenomenon

# 4. Discussion

* Concordia and the Halley VI samples: very different emotionality patterns
* Concordia
  * Affective Processes, ie, the overall expression of emotions
    gradually decreased with increasing isolation
  * Emotional Valence showed an overall declining trend until reaching a nadir
    in the Q3 period, and then it significantly improved in the Q4 period
    * components contributing to this pattern include
      * Positive Emotions, which was diminished in the second half of the
        winter-over season, and
      * Negative Emotions, particularly Anger, which were
        both expressed most markedly in the third quarter of the isolation
      * Otherwise, Anxiety was the highest in Q1 and the lowest in the Q4
      * Sadness showed no significant changes
* Halley VI
  * no significant changes were observed in any Emotionality Word categories
  * no evidence of the “third-quarter phenomenon”
  * TQP only detectable in Emotional Valence and Negative Emotions,
    particularly Anger, while
    Positive Emotions, Anxiety, and Sadness showed different patterns
  * literature: the phenomenon is inconsistent
    (Sandal, Leon, & Palinkas, 2006; Hawkes & Norris, 2017)
  * future: the circumstances under which Q3 or any other dynamic pattern is
    manifested
* The novelty of our study is the use of word-based content analysis for
  exploring the emotional patterns and time-effect thereon
  * fine-grained analysis of seven different aspects of emotionality
    (Affectivity, Positive Emotions, Negative Emotions, Emotional Valence,
    Anger, Anxiety, and Sadness) in two ICE samples
  * Such differences in the emotionality patterns between the two stations
    may be attributed to multiple factors
* A/another reasonable explanation
  * the more isolated a setting, the more negativity is expressed
    (ships < islands < coastal bases < deep inland bases < remote camps)
    (see, eg Sandal, 2000; Stuster+ 2000)
  * the role of cultural differences in the expression and withdrawal of emo
    * Pennebaker, Rimé, and Blankenship (1996) found
      correlations with geographical latitude and the occurrence of emo exp
    * increasing from north to south
    * Palinkas+ (2004) found evidence of cultural variation in changes in both
      mood and structural and functional characteristics of social dynamics
      during the winter in Antarctica
      * The results obtained in our two samples fit these patterns
