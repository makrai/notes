* predicting the relation of a given entity pair
* we propose to use variation inference to maximize the evidence lower bound.
* three modules, i.e. a posterior approximator, a prior (path finder), and a
  likelihood (path reasoner)

* reinforcement learning (RL) is good on clean data
* variational learning is better in noisy case
