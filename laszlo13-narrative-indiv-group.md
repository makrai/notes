Narrative Language as an Expression of Individual and Group Identity:
  The Narrative Categorical Content Analysis
SAGE Open April-June 2013: 1­–12

# Abstract

* NarrCat
* Psycho-Thematic modules, such as
  * Agency, Evaluation, Emotion, Cognition, Spatiality, and Temporality
* Relational Modules include
  * Social References, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and Negation
* Hypermodules, such as
  * Psychological Perspective and
  * Spatio-Temporal Perspective
  * complex, higher level exploration of composite psychological processes
* unique feature of NarrCat is its capacity of SRL

# Intro

* Linguistic Category Model (LCM) by Semin and Fiedler (1988)
  * three interrelated perspectives: as a functional tool, as architecture of
    linguistic behavior, and as an extended functional aspect (Semin, 2008)
* several intrinsically related new attributional paradigms
  * Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB; Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, & Semin, 1989;
      Sutton & Douglas, 2008) or the
  * Actor-Observer Bias (Fiedler, Semin, & Koppetsch, 1991; see Fiedler,
      2008, for a review). It has also been shown that
  * interpersonal transmission of stereotypes
    * linguistic categories play a subtle, but crucial role
    * Linguistic Expectancy Bias (LEB; Maass, Milesi, Zabbini, & Stahlberg,
      1995; Wigboldus, Semin, & Spears, 2000). In this context,
  * Negation Bias (Beukeboom, Finkenauer, & Wigboldus, 2010) and the
  * Stereotypic Explanatory Bias (Sekaquaptewa, Espinoza, Thompson, Vargas, &
    Von Hippel, 2003).  Although
  * lexical choice seems to be a powerful device in modulating
    social-psychologically relevant information in communication
    (Fiedler & Mata, 2013; Semin, 2000)
* thematic structure of a sentence ... may shift responsibility
  * Turnbull (1994)
  * Banga, Szabó, and László (2012) ... Syntactic Agency Bias (SAB)
    * intergroup relations ...  people tend to use less agentic forms (passive
      voice, general subject, etc.) when describing socially undesirable deeds
      of their own group, whereas they use
    * active forms when speaking about bad deeds of outgroups
* Pennebaker and his coworkers
  * Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software
  * (Chung & Pennebaker, 2007; Niederhoffer & Pennebaker, 2009;
    Pennebaker, 1990, 2012; Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003;
    Pennebaker, Paez, & Rime, 1997, and Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)
  * dozens of its—partly thematic and partly grammatical— word categories
* The Secret Life of Pronouns: What Our Words Say About Us (2011), Pennebaker
  follows the idea of “ignoring the content, celebrating the style”
* psycho mech
  * LCM, LIB, LEB, SAB, and the other models ... relate to message modulation
    for _perception_
  * Pennebaker’s ...  analysis inquires how these choices express _internal
    states_ of the [speakers]
* narrative approach
  * life stories as carriers and expressions of identity
  * Methodologically, it uses
    * qualitative (Polkinghorne, 1988; Sarbin, 1986) and
    * quali-quantitative (Bruner, 2005/1986; McAdams, 1988) methods
  * (Bruner, 2005/1986; Polkinghorne, 1988; Sarbin, 1986)
  * Several [theories with] qualitative and quantitative methods
    (Hiles & Cermak, 2008; McAdams, 1988; Murray, 2003)
* organizational characteristics and experiential qualities of group narratives
  and selfnarratives tell about the potential behavioral _adaptation and coping
  capacities_ of the storytellers
* whereas narratology studies effects of narrative composition on readers’
  understanding and experience, scientific narrative psychology is directed to
  how narrative composition expresses _inner states of the narrator_
* narrative composition here also refers to the _interpersonal and intergroup
  relations_
  * who feels or acts this content toward whom?

# Conceptualization of Content Analysis in NarrCat

* focus of NarrCat is
  * not on psychological correlates of words, nor on function words (as
    contrasted to contentual words), or on grammatical markers (past tense).
  * the evaluational, emotional, and cognitive processes of the self and the
    other, and the ingroup and the outgroup, furthermore
  * more complex principles of narrative composition,
    such as spatio-temporal perspective
* dictionaries
  * complex morphology of the Hungarian language and ...  disambiguation,
* tasks—anaphora resolution and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
  * A fully functional SRL analyzer requires ... anaphora resolution
  * external linguistic parsers + project-specific support modules in NarrCat

# Technological Background

NooJ, MNSZ

# The Structure of NarrCat

* dictionaries ... compiled from the ten thousand most frequent verbs,
  adjectives, nouns, and adverbs in Hungarian language,
* Psycho-Thematic Modules
  * main body of the NarrCat
  * Agency, Evaluation, Emotion, Cognition, Spatiality, and Temporality
  + Blank
* Relational Modules include
  * Social References, SRL, and Negation
* Hypermodules, such as
  * Psychological Perspective and Spatio-Temporal Perspective,
