Discovering automated lexicography

* semi-automated approach, which was devised in the last stages of database
  compilation, involved extracting corpus data, i.e. grammatical relations,
  collocations, examples, and grammatical labels

# Introduction

* multi-word expressions, form variations and neologisms automatically is a
  recognisable trend, multi-word expressions also having a dedicated COST
  action. Less frequent, but according to the survey a desired next step are
  automated procedures related to semantics: extraction of word senses (see
  also Cook et al. 2013; Cook et al. 2014), lexical semantic relations,
  definitions and knowledge rich contexts. In bilingual and multilingual
  lexicography, extraction of translation equivalents is also used.

# 2. Background

## 2.1. Lexicographic situation in Slovenia

* Slovene is listed among the less resourced languages in this area (Krek
  2012b).  However, in the past five years significant progress has been made
  in terms of the availability of language resources and tools for Slovene,
  largely on account of the Communication in Slovene project, which is
  described in the next section, and several smaller projects such as JOS
  (Erjavec et al. 2010), Termis (Logar 2013; Logar and Kosem 2013) and similar.
  Generally, the gap between Slovene and other languages in terms of the
  availability of resources, such as corpora and language-technology tools, is
  now much smaller than the persisting gap in availability of dictionary data

# 3 Slovene Lexical Database

* Slovene Lexical Database (SLD, Gantar and Krek 2011; Gantar et al. 2012). The
  SLD had a twofold goal: it was intended as the 
  * basis for the future compilation of different dictionaries of Slovene, both
    monolingual and bilingual, and as such 
    * its concept is biased towards lexicography
  * potential resource for the enhancement of NLP tools for Slovene.

* negative effect on lexicographers’ distribution of time (and effort) to
  different tasks – for example, for headwords with many (sub-)senses and
  syntactic patterns, lexicographers could on average dedicate less time to
  identifying different (sub-)senses and devising semantic frames and
  indicators for each (sub-)sense.  The process of selection of good examples
  for the database was identified as particularly problematic,
