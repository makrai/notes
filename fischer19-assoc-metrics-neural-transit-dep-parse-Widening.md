Association metrics in neural transition-based dependency parsing
Proceedings of the 2019 Workshop on Widening NLP

# Abstract

* Lexical preferences encoded as association metrics have been shown to improve
  on structural ambiguities that are still challenging for modern parsers
* This paper
  * include lexical preferences
    into a neural transition-based dependency parser for German
  * compare pointwise mutual information (PMI) and embedding-based scores
  * Both [models] outperform the baseline significantly
  * best model is PMI-based and
    increases overall performance by 0.26 LAS points over the baseline

# Intro

* e.g. Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and German] subject-object invers
* e.g. Dieses Problem muß auch die Post noch lösen.
  * Problem typically attaches to lösen ‘to solve’ as direct object.
