Association metrics in neural transition-based dependency parsing
Proceedings of the 2019 Workshop on Widening NLP

# Abstract

* Lexical preferences encoded as association metrics have been shown to improve
  on structural ambiguities that are still challenging for modern parsers
* This paper
  * include lexical preferences
    into a neural transition-based dependency parser for German. We
  * compare pointwise mutual information (PMI) and embedding-based scores
  * Both [models] outperform the baseline significantly. The
  * best model is PMI-based and
    increases overall performance by 0.26 LAS points over the baseline
