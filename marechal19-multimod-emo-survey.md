# Abstract

* analyze emotion in text, sound, image, video and physiological signals
* most important features for all available emotion recognition modes
* available platform and the existing projects

# 1 Intro

* gestures (body movements and postures), facial expression,
  acoustic characteristics and emotions expressed in the text
  * body signals and facial expressions recorded in real-time by sensors and
    cameras can be associated with predetermined emotions
* merge the multimodal information retrieved by these devices with information
  from analysis of emotions and intensity in text
* Mehrabian (1967) established the 7%– 38%–55% rule, also known as the “3V”
  * 7/38/55% of the communication is verbal/vocal/visual [1]
* emotion detection was born during the sixties/seventies
  * mood rings [2]
    * rings contain thermotropic liquid crystals that react with body temperat
    * When a person has stressed, his mood ring take on a darker color
* affective computing
  * pioneer: Picard (1990s) [3, 4] introduced a great progress in this field
  * emotion can be modeled using the nonlinear sigmoid function
  * ambient intelligence (AMI), virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
* eg automotive field
  * an on-board computer that is able to detect confusion, interest or fatigue
    can increase safety
  * AutoEmotive (MIT Media Lab) is a prototype equipped with sensors and a
    camera placed on the steering wheel [5]
  * When the need arises, he puts a background music, changes the temperature
    and light in the vehicle interior, or still proposes to follow a less
    stressful journey

* requirements on automatic emotion recognition:
  portability, non-intrusiveness, and low price
