Learning Sense-specific Word Embeddings By Exploiting Bilingual Resources
2014

# Abstract

* from bilingual parallel data
* We evaluate our embeddings using the
  * word similarity measurement and show that
    * our approach is significantly better
  * Chinese named entity recognition and obtain
    * noticeable improvements against single embeddings

  * (Gale+ 1992; Chan and Ng, 2005)
  * aligned bilingual data along with word sense inventories such as WordNet
  * We employ this idea
* datasets for context-unaware polysemous word similarity evaluation:
  * this paper [releases one]
