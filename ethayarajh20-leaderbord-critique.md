# Abstract

* Benchmarks such as GLUE have helped drive advances in NLP by incentivizing
* hE, a historical focus on performance-based evaluation has been at the
  expense of other qualities that the NLP community values in models, such as
  compactness, fairness, and energy efficiency
* In this opinion paper, we study the divergence between what is incentivized
  * what is useful in practice through the lens of microeconomic theory. We
    * both the leaderboard and NLP practitioners as consumers and
      the benefit they get from a model as its utility to them. With this
  * leaderboards – in their current form – can be poor proxies for the NLP comm
  * a highly inefficient model would provide less utility to practitioners but
    not to a leaderboard, since it is a cost that only the former must bear. To
  * we advocate reporting of statistics that are of practical concern
    (eg, model size, energy efficiency, and inference latency)
