# Abstract

* clinical databases in the study of mental disorders is essential to the
  diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental illness
  * unlike text corpora, speech corpora capture tones, emotions, rhythms
* we: from online databases and peer-reviewed journals
  * worldwide; reports from China; comparison between Chinese and non-Chinese
  * Most of the speech databases were recorded in Europe or the United States
  * mostly by audio or video
    * Some supplemented by brain images and Event-Related Potential (ERP) stats
    * eye-tracking
  * mostly developed for patients with
    * neurocognitive disorders like stutter and aphasia, and
    * mental illness, mostly dementia
    * scarce: bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and autism
  * China
    * db on neurocognitive disorders in China is much scarcer than that in Eu
    * existing databases pave an instructive road for psychiatric problems

# Background

* The term ‘mental disorder’ is defined by the WHO that comprises a wide range
  * characterized by some combination of abnormal thoughts, emotions, behaviors
    and relationships with others
  * eg schizophrenia, depression, intellectual disabilities and drug disorders
* Speech databases can be applied into many linguistic and non-linguistic
  * discourse analyses, language acquisition, neuroscience, sociology, and
    psychopathology, and so forth
  * databases of patients with mental disorders can offer statistical support
    * verbal productive and perceptive symptoms of stutterers, so as to provide
* brains can be learnt by AI for early screening and diagnosis. However, we
  * hE few speech databases in Asia compared with those in the western
  * special characteristics of their languages, the significance of building
* global epidemiology of mental disorders
  * hE data on mental disorders and the mortality rate in low/middle-income cnt
  * large-scale statistical collection on patients with mental disorders is
    mainly popular in Europe and the United States, while
  * few databases or corpora of mental health are available in Asia
* many existing studies are merely tentatively inductive and comparative
  case studies in a single aspect
  * falls behind in systematisation and standardisation
  * transfering from unimodal to multimodal

# Methods

## Data sources and search strategy

* We searched
  * international
    * five main databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and
      Cochrane Library with the
    * English keywords mental disorder, mental illness, corpus, database,
      language, data and speech. We also searched three
  * Chinese
    * databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI),
      Wanfang Data and the VIP Database with the corresponding Chinese
    * keywords mental disorder, mental disease, corpus, database, language
      disability and articulatory disability. Furthermore,
  * conference papers, registered trials and ongoing projects related to the
    * tests or trials on neurological disorders were also inspected for a wider
    * TalkBank,5 a professional online corpus initiated by Carnegie Mellon Uni
    * the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN)
      registry,6 a primary clinical trial registry recognised by the WHO and
      International Committee of Medical Journal Editors that accepts all
    * the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation
      (LREC),7 an international conference organised by the Eu Lang Rsrc Assoc
    * and WorldWide Science,8 a science website comprised of different
      scientific databases and portals around the globe.  Table 1 gives an
  * papers and databases that are relatively novel and no older than 15 years
  * 3310 English studies from five main English databases (Web of Science,
  * 58 studies from three main Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and VIP) were

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The selection criteria qualify studies included in the review from the global
* global research background, the studies were considered
  * eligible if they met the following criteria:
    * including patients with neurological disorders;
    * recording speeches by audio or video; and
    * functioning as public research resources for other researchers. Conversely,
  *  unqualified if they had the following characteristics:
    * targeting on ordinary people without neurological diseases;
    * transcribing speeches into written words rather than audio records; and
    * functioning as private supporting materials inaccessible to public usage
* Chinese research, databases from other countries and regions were excluded

## Study screening and data extraction

* listed contents: name of the speech database, establishment year, language,
  average age, number of subjects, location, media type, description and number
  of citations were shown in table 2. Among them, the number of citations was
* DAIC-WOZ 2014 English 50 USA Video Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic SD
  * University of Southern California

## Quality assessment of included studies

* we adopted the requirements for the establishment of the Corpus of Dutch
  Aphasic Speech (CoDAS)
  * CoDAS sets standards of text types, metadata and annotation
    that aphasia speech corpora should fulfil, and can be extended to a wider
    research field for other mental disorders
* corpora should fulfil at least the following requirements:
  * it should constitute a reasonable sample of patients within the region;
  * metadata about the subjects; and
  * the corpus should also include linguistic information such as POS tags,
    syntactic and prosodic annotation, as well as phonetic transcription
* remaining databases were ranked according to the number of subjects, speech
  length, media type and number of citations, so that it could offer a

# Results

## Characteristics of included studies

* no speech samples eg Yu+ conducted a unique correlate analysis of patients
  with schizophrenia in their disorganized speech,
  with the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication, in
  which Word Fluency Test was used without acquiring speech samples. They found
  * patients with schizophrenia got much higher scores on the poverty of
    content of speech, distractible speech, tangentiality, derailment, etc
  * raw materials of speech or their transcriptions were not provided or sysisd
* corpora and their subsidiary databases mainly apply the study methods of
  longitudinal tracking, language tasks or clinical analysis with a range of
  languages from English to German, Spanish, Croatian, Japanese, Mandarin, etc

## Comparison of the global and Chinese studies

### Speech databases from the globe

* non TalkBank: leading national or international programmes on patients with
  mental disorders whose speech transcriptions, audio or video recordings and
  brain recordings have been organised into publicly available speech databases

#### TalkBank

* The prominent contributor is TalkBank, which consists of the
  AphasiaBank, the DementiaBank, and the FluencyBank as shown in table 2. It is
  * multilingual corpus with lists of different research categories for
* DementiaBank is a shared database of communicative characteristics of
  * Becker+ have established Pitt Corpus in which written transcripts and audio
* AphasiaBank is an open database of multimedia approaches for the study of
  * Croatian (Kraljević+, 2017) and French (Colin and Le Meur12, 2017) are
* FluencyBank focuses on children or adults with communicative problems, such
  * stutter, late talking and disfluency. In this speech database,
  * Plasticity of Language in Epilepsy Research was a project (Gaillard+) 13

#### Independent speech corpora

* aphasic speech corpora, Westerhout and Monachesi15 developed a corpus
  * CoDAS with six participants. In this pilot study, they introduced basic
  * The Cambridge Cookie-Theft Corpus is an audio corpus
    * two tasks:
      * the Boston Cookie-Theft picture description task16 and a
      * spontaneous speech task, which contains a semiprompted monologue (where
        * general non-intrusive questions about their daily lives and hobbies),
          and/or free speech (no requirement of secondary prompting)
    * Interviews on patients aged 19–89 years were matched with a comparable
      number of healthy individuals (aged 20–89 years). What distinguishes it
    * also contains structural brain images of 32% of the patients and 18% of
      healthy individuals.  Research in language impairment is highly supported

#### Filtered[out] studies

* The majority of the filtered studies failed to meet public accessibility. Yet
* some of them offered inspiring possibilities for future directions of
  * Conroy21 carried out cognitive and mental tests of 50 people with
    relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to find out their difficulties in
    retrieving words
    * cognitive models applied the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised,
      the picture naming task (International Picture Naming Project, IPNP), the
      National Adult Reading Test (IPNP), and so on, accompanied by a
      one-time MRI scan and an in-depth neuropsychological assessment. In
  * Chakraborty+, patients with schizophrenia who were
    unable to identify emotion from voice due to their incapability in
    understanding low-level acoustic features, such as pitch, intensity,
    frequency, and so forth
    * Negative Symptom Assessment-16 scale23 rating method evaluated the behavior
      of those 78 participants (52 patients and 26 controls)
  * Patel+ compared the speaking abilities of patients with
    amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with the healthy controls. They applied
    * 3 speech categories (task-rehearsed, spontaneous and repeated word) for
    * speech was recorded by audio accompanied by an articulatory movement data
      * electromagnetic articulography
* self-evaluation was added to data collection
  * Volkmer25 tried to find out whether the communication training program of
    Better Conversations with Primary Progressive Aphasia improves
    * speech and language therapists asked the patients to analyze the video
      samples of their own conversation to identify points that facilitate or
      hinder communication. Similarly,
  * Beitchman+ launched a 26-year cohort study following up children with
    language problems from ages 5 to 31 years old
    * Dimensional psychosocial self-report measures were also adopted to
* Dudy+ designed a computer-assisted pronunciation training program that is
  * for phonologically disordered preschool and school-age children
  * Effective pronunciation training requires prolonged supervised practice and
  * 90 children aged 4–7 years (μ=5.3, σ=1.3) were recruited for the design of
  * 53 simple words elicited from describing images with the assistance of the

#### Employment of the speech databases

* picture description databases
  * The cookie-theft stimuli, the single black and white picture of the
    * one of the most used stimuli for the assessment of language production,
  * Boschi+ gave a review on the tasks of picture description, story narration
    and interview, for finding out possible different contributions to the
    assessment of different linguistic domains.  Images such as the picnic
    picture30 were used to develop a system that has 86.1% accuracy to predict
    early signs of cognitive decline; and the Picnic scene of Western Aphasia
    Battery31 or the tales of Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and
    the Little Red Riding Hood32 33 have also been used in various studies but
* DementiaBank, various studies in the past have employed this database. For
  * Fraser+ achieved over 81% differentiation accuracy in distinguishing
  * Orimaye+ applied DementiaBank to learn lexical, syntactic, and n-gram
    linguistic biomarkers to distinguish the people of potential AD from the
  * Masrani+ used the DementiaBank data to prove that the AUGMENT domain
    adaptation algorithm, which improved the F-measure by more than 7% over
    models trained on MCI data, is better than all current baseline algorithms
* AphasiaBank, Boyle37 applied the AphasiaBank stimuli to examine the
  test–retest reliability for word-retrieval errors in narration by individuals
  with aphasia. The results showed that
  * the test method was unreliable under each narrative subgenre. Furthermore,
  * whether the observed profiles were varied by race-ethnicity
  * Ellis and Peach38 conducted a retrospective study on a convenience sample
    * black PWAs exhibited lower scores in word fluency (5.5 vs 7.6; p=0.015),
      auditory word recognition (49.3 vs 53.3; p=0.02) and comprehension of
      sequential commands (43.7 vs 53.2; p=0.017) when compared with white
* WRAP, Mueller+ showed that participants with early MCI status had a faster
  decline in speech fluency and semantic cognition than those normal peers

### Speech databases from China

* earliest database development in Asia was spotted in Russia, Pakistan, India,
  Israel, etc
* Rahman+ developed an interventional method called ‘PASS’ (Parent-mediated
  Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders in South Asia) by applying
  * videos of parents and children’s interaction at play. They studied 119
* Bersudsky+ tested on 16 Russian immigrants to Israel aged 33–53 years,
  eight with schizophrenics and eight healthy immigrants for revealing
  * Short interviews around 10 min each were conducted, transcribed and coded
* Yu+ investigated into factors that led to the vulnerability of
  neuropsychological function in patients with Parkinson’s disease at the early
  * tests of memory, attention, visuospatial, and language functions, etc. were
* As for China’s studies, five were left for further consideration. Those
  * containing over 10 participants of patients with mental disorders in total,

  * they applied test models, parallel data and small-scale video or radio
    recordings for private usage

# Discussion

## Main findings

* number of subjects, the
  * Cambridge Cookie-Theft Corpus ranked first with 87 patients and 227
  * English Pitt that contains 208 patients and 104 controls, and
  * WRAP that includes 64 patients and 200
* speech length, Orozco-Arroyave Database comprises over 150 hours of speech
  divided in three sections: repetition of Spanish vowels,
* media type, 9 of 26 databases and subdatabases have video records, and one
  was supported by brain scans
* The number of citations illustrates the influence of those databases, which
  * AphasiaBank is most frequently cited by researchers, followed by
  * WRAP and DAIC-WOZ.  AphasiaBank is one of the pioneering database projects
* the best three
  * The three databases
    (Orozco-Arroyave Database, Cambridge Cookie-Theft Corpus, and DementiaBank)
  * multiple methods in data recordings, including biological indexes and brain
    scanning, or they may cover a
  * wide range of mental diseases such as anxiety, dementia, depression and
    PTSD. One common feature of them is the
  * large scale of participants, which is an indispensable necessity for a
    reliable and scientific research study
* as pioneering resources in neurocognitive areas
  * AphasiaBank and DementiaBank serve as pioneering resources in
    neurocognitive areas that may well provide references for future studies on
    mental disorder, especially the Cantonese AphasiaBank Database, which is
    the only one recorded in Chinese

## Limitations

* number of participants limited to 40 in the majority of the studies,
* mostly focus on patients with neurocognitive illness
  eg aphasia, stutter, and brain injuries, which reveal explicit signs of
  language disabilities in learning and delivering verbal or non-verbal
* inadequate number of existing corpora for patients with mental disorders
  eg dementia, schizophrenia, depression, autism and other mental diseases that
  may also reveal abnormalities in emotion, language usage, or behavior in
  communication, which should be taken into consideration

## Implications
