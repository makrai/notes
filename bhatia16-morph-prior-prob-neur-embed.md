#Abstract

* to generalize to rare or unseen words: incorporating morphological info
* The morphological information provides a prior distribution on the latent
  word embeddings, which in turn condition a likelihood function over an
  observed corpus
* This approach yields improvements on intrinsic word similarity evaluations,
  and also in the downstream task of part-of-speech tagging.
