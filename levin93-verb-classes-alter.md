English Verb Classes and Alternations -- A Preliminary Investigation
Beth Levin
1993

# Preface

* resource materials on the English verb lexicon make up this book
  * grew out of work begun as part of the cross-linguistic study of lexical
    organization and lexical representation undertaken [at] MIT in 1983-1987

# Introduction: The Theoretical Perspective 1

* This work is guided by the assumption that the [expression and interpretation
  of] arguments, is to a large extent deterrmined by its meaning

## The Nature of Lexical Knowledge 1

* Bloomfield (1933) wrote, "The lexicon is really an appendix of the
  grammar, a list of basic irregularities" (p 274)
  * conforms to [the desideratum that the lexicon] contains
    * the minimum information necessary
    * precisely the idiosyncratic information associated with each item
* Speakers of English also know extended meanings (or senses)
  * what Apresjan (1973) calls regular polysemy
  * eg Verbs like _whistle_ can be used as verbs of directed motion
    eg _The bullet whistled through the window_
    `*`_The dog barked down the street behind the jogger_

## Verb Meaning: A Key to Verb Behavior 4

* Hale and Keyser (1987) consider the archaic English verb _gaily_, a
  whaling term, used as in _The sailors gallied the whales._
* A speaker of English who is unfamiliar with this verb might assume that gaily
  means "see"/"frighten"
* on the basis of these assumptions about the meaning of gaily, the two
  speakers are able to make judgments about its syntactic behavior
* eg middle transitivity alternation
  * available only to change of state verbs such as frighten, cut, split
* _spray/load_(Rappaport and B. Levin,1988) and Pinker (1989)
* the church example (Hale and Keyser,1991) for a discussion of  and E. V
* more general discussion of coining verbs from nouns (Clark and H. H
  Clark,1979)
* extended meaning (B. Levin, 1991) and B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1991)
* causative/inchoative alternation in the following section
  * The window broke./The little boy broke the window

## A More Complex Example 5

* _break, cut, hit,_ and _touch_ (Fillmore 1967, Guerssel+ 1985, Hale and
  Keyser 1986, 1987, and Laughren 1988)
  * Each verb shows a distinct pattern [with respect to] three alternations
    * middle alternation differentiates among these four verbs
    * conative construction _cut at_
    * body-part alternation, _Margaret cut Bill on the arm._
  * other verbs that show the same pattern of behavior
    * Break Verbs: break, crack, rip, shatter, snap
    * Cut Verbs: cut, hack, saw, scratch, slash
    * Touch Verbs: pat, stroke, tickle, touch
    * Hit Verbs: bash, hit, kick, pound, tap, whack,
* relevant meaning components
  * the body-part possessor ascension alternation: contact
  * conative alternation: both motion and contact (Guerssel 85)
* other construction
  * associated zero-related nominals refer to the result/to the action
* summary:
  * _touch_ is a pure verb of contact,
  * _hit_ is a verb of contact by motion,
  * _cut_ is a verb of causing a change of state by moving something into contact
  * _break_ is a pure verb of change of state
* correlated with participation in diathesis alternations, including those
  * body-part alternation is sensitive to the notion of contact, while the
  * conative alternation is sensitive to both contact and motion.  The
  * causative/inchoative alternation is found [with] pure change of state,
  * middle alternation is found with causing a change of state
* manifested across languages by verbs of the same semantic types. To take one
  * the Australian language Warlpiri also shows the conative alternation
  * to the extent that languages are similar
    the same meaning components, and hence the same classes of verbs, figure in
    the statement of regularities concerning the expression of arguments
* The class[es] have in common a range of properties, including
  * the possible expression and interpretation of their arguments, and
  * existence of certain morphologically related forms

## The Larger Context 11

* Subcategorization frames
* "semantic bootstrapping" models of child language acquisition (Pinker 1989)
  are built on the assumption that a word's syntactic properties are
  predictable from its meaning

## Challenges 12

* identification of the appropriate representation of verb meaning
  * deviations from semantic/syntactic correlations might
    reflect the use of the wrong meaning components
* An illustration, discussed in B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1991, 1992)
  and repeated here, underscores the importance of carefully evaluating
  purported counterexamples to the hypothesis
* Unaccusative Hypothesis (Perlmutter 1978; Burzio 1986)
  * the single argument of the unaccusative verbs, is an underlying object,
  * meaning alone is not predictive of class membership (Rosen 1984)
    * bodily process verbs in Italian do not show uniform behavior:
      * _russare_ 'snore' patterns like an unergative verb, while
      * _arrossire_ 'blush, elpirul' patterns like an unaccusative verb
* [these] verbs would be expected to show similar behavior only if the
  semantic notion "bodily process" plays a part in determining a verb's status
  * other possible characterizations of bodily process verbs. English
    * _snore_ can be classified as an activity in the sense of Vendler (1957)
    * _blush_ is open either to an activity or to a change of state

## The Underlying Research Methodology 14

* Once [a class with respect to diathesis alternations] is identified, it
  can be examined to isolate the meaning components they have in common
  * Thus diathesis alternations can be used to provide a probe into the
    elements entering into the lexical representation of word meaning
  * A similar approach is proposed and illustrated by Deane and Wheeler (1984),
    who call it "correlation analysis"
    * See also Green (1974, 66-69) and Wierzbicka (1987, 24-26)
* example is provided by verbs of motion
  * this class is not homogeneous (B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav 199). It
  * subclasses
    * inherently directed motion (eg arrive, come, go) and a subclass of
    * manner of motion (eg jump, run, trot, skip)
  * In the absence of a directional prepositional phrase [they] describe the
    direction [vs] the manner of motion
  * some verbs of manner of motion do not necessarily entail any
    displacement, as in run in place
* _run_ and _whistle_ are in some respects more similar to each other
  than the verbs _run_ and _come_
  * can be used as verbs of directed motion
    in the presence of a directional prepositional phrase
  * as noted in B. Levin and Pinker (1991)
* meaning components identified via the study of semantic/syntactic correlation
  show considerable overlap with [those posited in] language acquisition
  (Jackendoff 1983, 1990b, G.A. Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976, Pinker 1989)
* investigation of intricate and extensive patterns of syntactic behavior
  * subcategorizaiion frame of a verb, but also examines a wider constellation
  * diathesis alternations, and also to a more limited extent its
  * morphological properties and extended meanings

## The Scope of this Book 17

* Part I diathesis alternations that are relevant to lexical knowledge
* Part II presents a large number of semantically coherent classes of verbs
* This book tries to strike a balance between breadth and depth of coverage
  * Many of the diathesis alternations and verb classes included are well studid
  * Others have received relatively little attention
* classificatory distinctions in this book have been drawn using criteria of
  * the expression of arguments of verbs,
    * including alternate expressions of arguments and special interpretations
  * morphological properties of verbs, such as the
    existence of various types of related nominals and adjectives
* The important theoretical construct is [meaning component, not] verb class
  also argued for by Mufwene (1978) in a follow-up to Zwicky's (1971a)
* This book presents a snapshot of ongoing research. It is
  * by no means a definitive and exhaustive classification of the verbs
  * design decisions
    * The verb classes were chosen because their members participated in
      diathesis alternations or showed _behavior that was closely related_ to
      that of other verbs found in particular alternations
  * ignored
    * Verbs taking sentential complements
      except when they show interesting behavior with NP or PP complements. 10
    * verbs derived by productive morphological processes, such as
      * so-called zero-deriv[ation]
      * prefixation (un-, de-, dis-, re-, etc.) or
        suffixation (-ify, -ize, -en, etc.)
    * inherent lexical aspect of verbs (aktionsart)
      * Bach (1981+), Brinton (1988), Declerck (1979), Dowty (1979),
        Freed (1979), Hinrichs (1985), Kenny (1963), Lys (1988),
        Mourelatos (1978), Tenny (1987+), Vendler (1957), Verkuyl (1972+)
      * The connection between the [classes] discussed here and lexical aspect
        needs to be carefully investigated
* decision not to illustrate a consistent set of properties across all the verb
  classes identified in Part II of this book
  * eg _fill_ expresses its arguments in a frame resembling one of the
    variants of the locative alternation, and it is similar in meaning to
    locative alternation verbs like spray and load,
    * it makes sense to include among the properties of fill's verb class that
      its members do not undergo the locative alternation
    * Similarly, in Part I of the book only some classes of verbs that do not
      display a particular diathesis alternation are noted

## The Layout of the Book

* The alternations are subdivided into groups
  on the basis of the syntactic frames involved
  1. transitivity alternations, while
  2. alternate expressions of arguments (mostly within the verb phrase)
  3. permit "oblique" subjects. These major groups of alternations are followed
  4. a variety of other types
* it is an open research question whether a complete _hierarchical_ organization
  of English verb _classes_ is possible or even desirable
