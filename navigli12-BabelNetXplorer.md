BabelNetXplorer: A Platform for Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base 
  Access and Exploration

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Previous endeavors are either not freely available (EuroWordNet [16]), or are
only accessible via a Web interface (cf. the Multilingual Research Repository
[1] and MENTA [2]), or provide only ‘raw’ data with no library for programmatic
access (e.g.  WikiNet [6]).

# 2 BABELNET

Multilingual lexicalizations for all concepts are collected from Wikipedia’s
inter-language links ... as well as by filling the translation gaps
