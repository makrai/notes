# Abstract

* PhD proposal
* we plan to introduce
  an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated dataset. Using this
  * develop and evaluate conventional discriminative models, generative LLMs,
    and embedding-based retrieval approaches against four main
* criteria: interpretability, ground-truth adherence, accuracy, and
  computational efficiency
* case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology

## Textual Features and Self-Aspects Correlations

### Self-Aspects Most research focuses on I-talk, i.e., the use of 

* first-person pronouns as indicators of Self-focus (Pennebaker+ 2003), which
  correlates with emotional pain, trauma, and depression
  (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010)
  * Self vs others (Na and Choi, 2009; Sharpless, 1985). The usage of 
* active vs passive voice can shed light on the sense of agency of the author 
  (Simchon+ 2023), while 
* the Narrative Self (NS)
  * i.e., “the narrative someone has of themselves, comprising their
    autobiographical memories and stories of who they are” 
  * Caporusso+ (2024) is 
  * reflected in the structure and coherence of one’s autobiographical accounts
    (Habermas and Köber, 2015; Holm+ 2016; Jaeger+ 2014; Waters and Fivush,
    2015). In this context, 
* Author profiling (AP) refers to 
  the task of inferring personal characteristics of an author
  based on their writing, which has 
  applications in, e.g., sociolinguistics and mental health analytics
  (Eke+ 2019; Ouni+ 2023b)
* the Minimal Self (MS; “the fact that experiences are presented to us in a
  fundamentally personal and subjective way” Caporusso+ 2024), are less explored
  (Uno and Imaizumi, 2025).
* Caporusso+ (2024) investigated the LIWC categories associated with different
  aspects of the Self: 
  * MS, 
  * NS, 
  * Self as Agent (AS; “the experience of being an agent, i.e., in control,
    active”), 
  * Bodily Self (BS; “the experience of owning, controlling, and/or identifying
    with someone’s own body (or parts of it)”), and 
  * Social Self (SS; “the self as it is shaped and/or perceived when in an
    interaction or relationship of sorts with other people or entities to whom
    we attribute qualities of an inner life”)
