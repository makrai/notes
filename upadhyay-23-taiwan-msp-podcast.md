# Abstract

* speech emotion recognition (SER) 
  * aims: scientifically rigorous systems that can reliably characterize
* naturalistic large-scale, reliable emotional recordings. Also, the
* best practices for data collection are not necessarily described or shared
* we propose the creation of an affective naturalistic database consortium
  (AndC) that can encourage multidisciplinary cooperation
* contribution is twofold.
  * the design of the AndC with a customizable-standard framework for
    intelligently-controlled emotional data collection. The focus is on
    leveraging naturalistic spontaneous recordings available on audio-sharing
    websites.
* case study the development of a naturalistic large-scale Taiwanese Mandarin
  podcast corpus using the customizable-standard intelligently-controlled
