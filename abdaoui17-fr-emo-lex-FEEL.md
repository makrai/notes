# Abstract

* considering both polarity and emotion. The elaboration method is 
* based on the semi-automatic translation and expansion to synonyms of the
  English NRC Word Emotion Association Lexicon (NRC-EmoLex). 
  * First, 6 online translators have been automatically queried in order to create
  * Then, a human professional translator manually validated the entries and the
    * agreed with more than 94 % of the pre-validated entries (those found by a
      majority of translators) and less than 18 % of the remaining entries
* Annotating a subset of terms by three different annotators shows that the
* extensive experiments have been conducted to compare the final version of FEEL
  with other existing French lexicons. Various French benchmarks for polarity
  and emotion classifications have been used in these evaluations. Experiments
  have shown that FEEL obtains competitive results for polarity, and
  significantly better results for basic emotions

# 1 Introduction

* Sentiment lexicons organize lists of words, phrases or idioms into classes
  (Devitt and Ahmad 2013; Turney 2002). For example, in 
  * NRC-EmoLex (Mohammad and Turney 2013), starting point of this study, terms
* emotion typologies (Ekman 1992; Francisco and Gervás 2006; Pearl and
    Steyvers 2010; Plutchik 1980). The 
  * most famous and at the same time the simplest typology is by Ekman
    * considered in much of emotion classification studies (Mohammad and
      Kiritchenko 2015; Roberts+ 2012; Strapparava and Valitutti 2004).
* we describe the elaboration of a new French lexicon containing more than
  * 14,000 terms according to their 
    * polarities (positive and negative) and their expressed emotions
    * Ekman basic emotions).  The applied method is based on the automatic
* NRC-EmoLex, a publically available emotion lexicon which has 
  * proven its performance in several sentiment and emotion classification tasks
    (Kiritchenko+  2014; Mohammad 2012; Rosenthal+ 2015). The translations have
