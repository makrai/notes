* Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involves two tasks: 
  * aspect extraction and polarity detection. The first task is responsible for
* the SOTA in ABSA consists of the application of deep learning methods such as
  recurrent, convolutional and attention neural networks. The limitation of
  * they require a lot of training data and are computationally expensive.  In
* we propose a simple approach called SUAEx for aspect extraction.  SUAEx is
  * unsupervised and relies solely on the similarity of word embeddings.
  * Experimental results on datasets from three different domains have shown
    * outperform the SOTA attention-based approach at a fraction of the time.
