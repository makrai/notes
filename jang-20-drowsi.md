# Abstract

* we use facial recognition technology and eye-blink recognition technology.
  Additionally, a CO2 sensor chip was used to detect additional drowsiness.
* Speech recognition technology can also be used to apply Speech to Text (STT),
  allowing a driver to request their desired music or make a call
