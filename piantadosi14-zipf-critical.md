Zipf’s word frequency law in natural language: 
  A critical review and future directions 
Psychon Bull Rev (2014) 21:1112–1130

# Introduction

# The word frequency distribution is complex 3

# Empirical phenomena in word frequencies 5

## Semantics strongly influences word frequency


* many accounts of the law make no reference to meaning and semantics 
  * (except see [sections] Semantic Accounts [and] Communicative Accounts)

    section), deriving it from principles independent of the content of
    language. But this view is incompatible with the fact that even cross-
    linguistically, meaning is systematically related to frequency. 
  * Calude and
    Pagel (2011) ... reported an average interlanguage correlation in log
    frequency of R = .53 (p < .0001) for [Swadesh] words, indicating that

## Near-Zipfian distributions occur for fixed referential content

## Near-Zipfian distributions occur for naturally constrained meanings

## The fit of Zipfian distributions vary by category

## The distribution of word frequencies is not stationary

## Word frequency varies according to many forces

## Power laws arise from (almost) nothing

## Zipf’s law occurs in other human systems

# Models of Zipf’s law 11

# Conclusion and forward directions 16
