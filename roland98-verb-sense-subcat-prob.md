Verb Sense and Verb Subcategorization Probabilities
Douglas Roland and Daniel Jurafsky
1998 CUNY Sentence Processing Conference

#Introduction

* Even after controlling for the above context effects, we found variation in
  subcategorization frequencies. We show that much of this remaining variation
  is due to the use of different senses of the same verb
* Furthermore, when context-based variation is controlled for, each verb sense
  tends towards having unified subcategorization probability across sources
* The lemma (our definition follows Levelt (1989) and others) is the locus of
  semantic information in the lexical entry. Thus we assume that the verb
  _hear_ meaning `to try a legal case` and _hear_ meaning `to perceive
  auditorily` are distinct lemmas. Also following Levelt, we assume that a
  lemma expresses expectations for syntactic and semantic arguments
