# Abstract

* Twitter is currently a popular online social media platform
  * crucial to healthcare technologies
  * automatically discovering mental health problems, eg depression
  * Previous studies to automatically detect a depressed user on online social
    media have largely relied upon the user behaviour and their linguistic
    * eg user's social interactions
    * hE several irrelevant content which might not be crucial
* we initially select relevant content
  through a hybrid extractive and abstractive summarization strategy on the
  sequence of all user tweets
  * novel deep learning framework comprising of a unified learning machinery
  * Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled with attention-enhanced GRU
* better empirical performance than existing strong baselines
