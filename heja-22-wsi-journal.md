# ABSTRACT

* The Word-in-Context corpus, which forms part of the SuperGLUE benchmark
  * focuses on a specific sense disambiguation task: it has to be decided
    whether two occurrences of a given target word in two different contexts
    convey the same meaning or not
  * hE relatively low consistency in terms of inter-annotator agreement, which
  * we: a graph-based distributional approach, where both
    sparse and dense adjectival vector representations served as input.
  * criteria as to when the same meaning should be assigned to the occurrences.
  * not rely on any external knowledge base
