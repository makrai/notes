The Logical Form of Action Sentences
Davidson
1967

* _Jones did it slowly, deliberately, in the bathroom, with a knife, at midn._
  * What he did was butter a piece of toast. We are roo familiar
  * language of action
  * the _it_ seems to refer to some entity, preswnably an action,
    that is chen characterized in a number of ways. Asked for the
  * logical form of this sentence:
    'There is an action x such that Jones did x slowly and Jones did x delibera'
  * no singular term to substirure for 'x'
    * substitute for 'x' and get
      'Jones buttered a piece of toast slowly and Jones buttered a piece of t..'
  * Another sign that we don't have the logical form of the sentence is that
    in this last version there is
    no implication that a single action was slow, deliberate, and in the bathr,
* The present Essay is devoted to trying to get
  * the logical form of simple sentences about anions straight. I would like to
  * an account of the logical or grammatical role of the parts or words of such
    sentences that is
    consistent with the entailment relations between such sentences and
    with whar is known of the role of those same parts or words in other
    (non-action} sentences
  * = showing how the meanings of acrion sentences depend on their structure. I
  * nor concerned with
    * eg the meaning of deiiberarely' as opposed, perhaps, to 'voluntary'; bur I
    * the difference between 'Joe believes/knows that there is life on Mars' and 'Joe
      * no difference in logical form. That the
      * second, bur nor the first, entails 'There is life on Mars' is plausible
      * but emerges only from the meaning analysis of 'believes' and 'knows'.
  * there is something arbitrary in how much of logic to pin on logical form.
  * uncover enough structure co make it possible to scare, for an arbitrary
    sentence, how its meaning depends on that StfUCCUre, and we must nor
    attribute more structure than such a theory of meaning can accommodate.
* eg (1) Jones buttered the coast slowly, deliberately, in the bathroom, with a
  knife, at midnight.
  * cannot treat the 'deliberately' on a par with the other modifying clauses.
    * It alone imputes intention, for of course Jones may have buttered the coast
    * postpone dis­ cussion of the 'deliberately' and its intentional kindred.
  * 'Slowly', unlike the other adverbial clauses,
    fails co introduce a new entity (a place, an instrument, a time), and also
* eg Susan says, 'I crossed the Channel in fifteen hours.'
  'Good grief, that was slow/%slowly.'
  * what does 'that' refer to? No appropriate singular rerm appears in 'I
  * Now Susan adds, 'But I swam.' 'Good grief, that was fast.' We do
    * not withdraw the claim that it was a slow crossing; this is consistent
    * its being a fasr swimming. Here we have enough to show, I think,
* 'It was a slow crossing' != 'It was slow and it was a crossing'
  since the crossing may also be a swimming that was nor slow, in which case we
  => "It was slow & it was a crossing & it was a swimming & it was not slow.'
* not specific for actions,
  * the logical role of the attributive adjectives in
    'Grundy was a short basketball player, but a tall than', and
    'This is a good memento of the murder, but a poor steak knife.'
* The problem of arrriburives
  is indeed a problem abouc logical form, bur it
  may be put to one side here because it is not spec for action sentences
* We have decided co ignore, for the moment ar least, the first two adverbial
  (2) Jones buttered the toast in the bathroom with a knife at midnight.
  Kenny (ch vii same vol): most philosophers today would, as a Start, analyse
  this sentence as containing a five-place predicate with the

    * obliterate that (2) entails the others. Or, to put the objecrion
    * the original sentences contain a common syntactic element ('buttered')
      * But the proposed analyses show no such common element.
* Kenny rejects the suggestion that
  'Jones burrered the toast' be considered as
  elliptical for 'Jones buttered the toast somewhere with something ar s time',
  * would rescore the wanted entailments, on the ground that

* action suggests the same idea: that there are such things as actions, and that
  a sentence like (2) describes the action in a number of ways
  * 'Jones did it with a knife.' 'Please rell the more about it.' The 'it' here
    doesn't refer to Jones or the knife, bur to what Jones did---or so it seems.
* Austin's discussion of excuses illustrates over and over the faer that our
  common talk and reasoning about actions is most naturally analysed by
  supposing that there are such entities.
* what is the relation between my pointing the gun and pulling the trigger, and
  my sheering the victim? The natural and, 1 think, correct answer is that
  * the relation is that of identity
  * The logic of this sort of excuse includes, it seems, at least this
  : I am accused of doing b, which is deplorable
  1 admit I did a, which is excusable
  My excuse for doing b rests upon my claim that 1 did nor know that a = b.
* Anomer pattern of excuse would have the allow that I shot the victim
  intentionally, bur in self-defence
  * Now the structure includes something more.
  * I am still accused of b (my shooting the victim), which is deplorable
  * I admit 1 did c (my shooting the victim in self-defence), which is
    excusable
  * My excuse for doing b rests upon my claim that I knew or believed that b = c
* Again I shoot the victim, again inten­ tionally
  * What 1 am asked to explain is my shooting of the bank president (d), for the
  * My excuse is that I shot the escaping murderer (e), and surprising and
  * my shooting the escaping murderer and my shooting of the bank president were
    one and the same action __since__ it is the same person
  * To justify the 'since' we must presumably think of
    'my shooting of x' as a functional expression that
    names an action when the 'x' is replaced by an appropriate singular term.
    The relevant reasoning would then be an application of x= y => fx = fy

  of 'alternative descriptions of the same action' seriously, i.e., literally.
  * plenry of other contexts in which the same need presses
  * Explaining an action by giving an intention with which it was done

    action in the context of a rule ('I am castling'), give the outcome
    ('I killed him'), or provide evaluation ('I did the right thing').

  by running the patient down with his Lincoln Continental
  * In neither case would we say the doctor removed the patient's appendix.
* Closer approximations to a correct analysis might be,
  'The doctor brought it about that the doctor has removed the patient's
  appendix'
  or perhaps,
  'The doctor brought it about that the patient has had his appendix removed by
  the donor.' One may still have a few
  * doubts as to whether these sentences have the same truth conditions as 'The

* A natural move, then, is to allow that the sentence that replaces 'p' in 'x

    * independent of the question what sentence we substitute for 'p'o Whatevet
    * we are to interpret `p` as describing some event
    * whole sentences of the form 'x makes it happen that p' also describe
      events
    * are these events the same evenr, or they are different? If they are the
      * if same , as many people would claim (perhaps including Chisholm), then
        no maner what we put for 'p', we cannot have solved the general problem
      * If different events, how has the elemenc of agency been introduced inro
        the larger sentence though it is lacking in the sentence for which `p`
        stands; for each has the agenr as its subject. The answer Chisholm
        gives, I think, is that
        the special notion of making it happen chat he has in mind is
        intentional, and thus co be disringuished from simply causing something
        eg we want to say that Alice broke the mirror without implying that
        she did it intentionally. Then
        * Chisholm's special idiom is not called for; but
        * we could say, 'Alice caused it to happen that the mirror broke.'
        * Suppose we now want to add that she did it intentionally. Then the
          * Chisholm-sentence would be: 'Alice made it happen that Alice caused
            it to happen that the mirror broke.' And now we want co know,
what is the event that che whole sentence reports, and that the contained sentence
does not? It is, apparently, just whar used ro be called an act of the will. I will not
dredge up the standard objections co the view thee acts of the will are special
events distinct from, say. our bodily movements. and perhaps the causes of them.
But even if Chisholm is willing co accept such a view, the problem of the logical
form of the sentences that can replace `p` remains, and these describe the things
people do as we describe them when we do nor impute intention.

A somewhat different view has been developed with care and precision by von
Wright. 6 In effect, von Wright puts action sentences into the following form: "x
brings it about that a state where p changes into a state where q'. Thus the
important relevanr difference between von Wright's analysis and the ones we
have been considering is the more complex srrucrure of the description of the
change or event the agenr brings about: where Kenny and Chisholm were
conrenr to describe the result of the change, von Wright includes also a
description of the initial state,

Von Wright is interested in exploring the logic of change and action and not,
at least primarily, in giving the logical form of our common sentences about acts
or events. For the purposes of his study, it may be vecy fruitful to think ofevents
as ordered pairs of states. But I think it is also fairly obvious that this does nor
give us a standard way of translating or representing the form of most sentences
about acts and events. If I walk from San Francisco ro Pittsburgh, for example,
my initial state is that I am in San Francisco and my terminal srare is that I am
in Pittsburgh; bur the same is more pleasantly true if I fly. Of course, we
may describe the terminal state as my having walked to Pittsburgh from San

Francisco, bur then we no longer need the separate statement of the initial state,

Indeed, viewed as an analysis of ordinary sentences about actions, von Wright's
proposal seems subject co all the difficulties I have already outlined plus the extra
one that mosr action sentences do not yield a non-trivial description of the initial
scare (try 'He circled the field', 'He recited the Odyssey', 'He Airted with Olga).

In two matters, however, it seems ro the von Wright suggests important and
valuable changes in the pattern of analysis we have been considering, or at least in
our interpretation of it. Pirsr, he says that an action is not an event, bur rather the

bringing about of an event. I do not mink chis can be correct. If I fall down, chis
is an event whether I do it intentionally or not. If you thought my falling was an
accident and later discovered I did it On purpose, you would not be tempted to
withdraw your claim that you had witnessed an event. I rake von Wrighr's refusal
to call an action an event to reflect
embarrassment we found to follow if we
say that an act is an event, taking agency to be introduced by a phrase like 'brings
it about that', The solution lies, however, not in distinguishing acts from events,
but in finding a different logical form for action sentences. The second important
idea von Wright introduces comes in the context of his distinction between
genn-icand individual propositions about events." The distinction, as von Wright
makes it, is not quite clear, for he says both: that an individual proposition differs
from a generic one in having a uniquely determined truth value, while a generic
proposition has a truth value only when coupled with an occasion; and that. that

Brutus killed Caesar is an individual proposition while that Brutus kissed. Caesar
is a generic proposition, because 'a person an be kissed by another on more than
one occasion'. In facr the proposition that Brutus kissed Caesar seems to have a
uniquely determined truth value in the same sense that the proposinon that

Brutus killed Caesar does. But it is, I believe, a very important observarion
that 'Brutus kissed Caesar' does nor, by virtue of its meaning alone, describe
a single act.

It is easy ro see that the proposals we have been considering concerning the
logical form of action sentences do not yield solutions to the problems with
which we began. I have already pointed our that Kenny's problem, that verbs of
action apparently have 'variable polyadicity', arises within the sentences that can
replace 'p' in such formulas as 'x broughr it about that p'. An analogous remark
goes for von Wright's more elaborate formula. The other main problem may be
put as chat of assigning a logical form to action sentences that will justify claims
that two sentences describe 'the same action'. Our study of some of the ways in
which we excuse, Or attempt ro excuse, acts shows that we want to make infer­
ences such as chis: I flew my spaceship to the Morning Star, che Morning Star is
identical with the Evening Star; so, I flew my spaceship to the Evening Star. (My
leader told the not (0 go the Evening Star; 1 headed for the Morning Star not
knowing.) But suppose we translate the action sentences along the lines suggested
by Kenny or Chisholm or von Wright. Then we have somerhing like. 'I brought
it about that my spaceship is on the Morning Star.' How can we infer, given the
well-known identity, 'I broughr it abour that my spaceship is on the Evening

Star'? We know that if we replace 'the Morning Star' by 'the Evening Srar' in,
'My spaceship is on the Morning Star' the truth-value will not be disturbed; and
so if the Occurrence of this sentence in, 'I broughr it about that my spaceship is
on the Morning Star' is trurh-hmctional, the inference is justified. But of

COurse the occurrence can't be truth-hmctional: otherwise, from the facr that

I brought about one actual state of affairs it would follow that I brought about
every actual state of affairs. lt is no good saying that after the words 'bring it
about that' sentences describe something between trum-values and propositions,
say states of affairs. Such a claim must be backed by a semantic theory telling us
how each sentence determines the state of affairs it does; otherwise the claim
is empry.

Israel Scheffier has put forward an analysis of sentences about choice that can
be applied without serious modification to sentences about intentional acts.e

Scheffier makes no suggestion concerning action sentences that do nor impute
intention, and so has no solution to the chief problems I am discussing.

Nevertheless, his analysis has a fearure I should like to mention. Scheffler would
have us render, 'Jones intentionally buttered the toast' as, 'Jones made-true a that

Iones-buttered-the-roasc inscription.' This cannot, for reasons 1 have urged in
detail elsewhere,s be considered a finally satisfying form for such sentences
because it COntains the logically unstructured predicate 'is a that Jones-buttered­
the-toast inscription', and there are an infinite number of such semancical pri­
mitives in the language. But in one respect, I believe Scheffler's analysis is clearly
superior ro the others, for it implies that inrroducing the elemenr of intention­
aliry does not call for a reduction in the COntent of the sentence that expresses
what was done intentionally. This brings out a faCt otherwise suppressed, that, to
use Ourexample, 'Jones' turns up twice, Once inside and once outside the scope of
the intensional operator. I shall return to this point.

A discussion of the logical form of action sentences in ordinary language is to
be found in the justly famed Chapter VII of Reichenbach's Elements o[Symbolic

IO

Logic. According to Reichenbach's doctrine, we may transform a sentence like
(4) Amundsen flew to the North pole

into:
(5) (3x) (x consists in the fact that Amundsen Aew to the North Pole).

The expression 'is an event that COnsists in the fact chat' is to beviewed as an operator
which, when prefixed to a sentence, forms a predicate ofevents. Reichenbach does
nor think of (5) as shOwing or revealing the logical form of (4), for he thinks (4) is
unproblematic. Rather he says (5) is logically equivalent to (4). (5) has its coun­
terparr in a more ordinary idiom:
(6) A flight by Amundsen to the North Pole took place.


Thus Reichenbach seems to hold that we have two ways of expressing the same
idea, (4) and (6); they have quite different logical forms, but they are logically
equivalenr, one speaks lirerally of events while the other does nor. I believe chis

view spoils much of the merit in Reichenbach's proposal, and chat we must
abandon the idea that (4) has an unproblematic logical form distinct from that of
(5) or (6). Following Reichenbach's formula for putting any action sentence inro
the form of (5) we translate

()' consists in the fact that (3x) (x consists in the fact that 2 + 3 = 5))'? And so on.

Ir isn't clear on what principle the decision to apply the analysis is based.

The second objection is worse. We have:
(10) (3x) (x consists in the fact that I flew my spaceship to the Morning Star)

and

mro:

(II) the Morning Star = the Evening Srar

(8) (3x) (x consists in the fact that Amundsen flew Co the North Pole in May
1926).

The fact that (8) entails (5) is no more obvious than that (7) entails (4); what was
obscure remains obscure. The correct way to render (7) is:
(9) (3x) (x consists in [he fact mar Amundsen flew

to

the North Pole and x

took place in May 1926).

But (9) does nor bear the simple relation to the standard way of interpreting (7)
that (8) does. We do not know of any logical operation on (7) as it would usually
be formalised (with a three-place predicate) that would make it logically equi­
valent to (9). This is why I suggest that we trear (9) alone as giving the logical
form of (7). If we follow this sttategy, Kenny', problem of the 'variable poly­
adicity' of action verbs is on the way to soiunon: there is, of course, no variable
polyadicity. The problem is solved in the natural way, by introducing events as
entities about which an indefinite number of things can be said.

Reichenbach's proposal has another attractive feature: it eliminates a peculiar
confusion that seemed to attach to the idea that sentences like (7) 'describe an
event'. The difficulty was thac one wavered between thinking of the sentence as
describing or referring to that one flight Amundsen made in May 1926, or as
describing a kind ofevent, or perhaps as describing (potentially?) several. A5 von

Wtight pointed out, any number of events might be described by a sentence like
'Brutus kissed Caesar.' This fog is dispelled in a way I find entirely persuasive by

Reichenbach's proposal that ordinary action sentences have, in effect, an exist­
ential quantifier binding the action-variable. \'Qhen we were tempted into
chinking a sentence like (7) describes a single evenr we were misled: it does not
describe any event at all. But if (7) is true, then there is an event that makes it
true. (This unrecognized element of generality in action sentences is, I think, of
the utmost importance in understanding the relation between actions and
desires.]

There are two objections to Reichenbach's analysis of acrion sentences: The
first may noc be fatal. It is that as matters stand the analysis may be applied to any
sentence whatsoever, whether it deals with actions, events, or anything else. Even
'2+3=5' becomes '(3x) (x consisrs in the fact that 2+3=5)'. Why uot say
'2 + 3 = 5' does not show ics true colours until pur through the machine? For that
matter, are we finished when we get to the first step? Shouldn't we go on to '(3)')

and we want to make the inference to
(12) (3x) (x consists in the fact that I flew my spaceship to the Evening Star).


The likely principle to jusrify the inference would be:
(13) (x) (x consists in the fact that S+-+x consists in the fact that S')

where '5" is obtained from '5' by substituting, in one or more places, a
co-referring singular term. Ir is plausible co add that (13) holds if'S' and'S' are
logically equivalent. But (13) and the last assumption lead to trouble. For
observing that '5' is logically equivalent to 'j (y=)' & 5) = j ()'=)')' we get
(14) (x) (x consists in the face that 5 f - I

S) = j (y= y))).


X

consists in the fact that (j(y=)' &


Now suppose 'R' is any sentence materially equivalent to '5': then 'j()'=)' & 5)'
and 'y(y=)' & R)' will refer to the same thing. Subsriruring in (14) we obtain
(15) (x) (x consists in the facr that 5 e-e X consists in che fact that (j()' = )' &

R) =.Y<.r= y)),

which leads co
(16) (x) (x consists in the fact that 5 f - I


X

consists in the facr that R)

when we observe the logical equivalence of'R' and :9(y=.r & R) = j(y=y)'. (16)
may be interpreted as saying (considering that the sale assumption is that 'R' and
'5' are materially equivalent) that all events that occur (= all events) are identical.

This demonstrates, I think. that Reichenbach's analysis is radically defective.

Now I would like to put forward an analysis of action sentences that seems co
the to combine most of the merirs of the alternatives already discussed, and (Q
avoid the difficulties. The basic idea is that verbs of action-verbs that say 'what
someone did'<c-should be construed as containing a place, for singular terms or
variables, that they do not appear (0. For example, we would normally suppose
that 'Shem kicked Shaun' consisted in two names and a two-place predicate.

I suggesr, though, that we thinkof'kicked' as a three-place predicate, and that the
sentence to be given in [his form:

(17) (3x) (Kicked(Shem, Shaun,

The Essential Davidson


The Logical Form ofAction Sentences


If we try foe an English sentence that directly reflects this form, we run into
difficulties. 'There is an evenr x such that x is a kicking of Shaun by Shern' is
about the best I can do, but we must remember 'a kicking' is not a singular term.

Given this English reading, my proposal may sound very like Reichenbach's; but
of course it has quite different logical properties. The sentence 'Shem kicked

Shaun' nowhere appears inside my analytic sentence, and this makes it differ
from all the theories we have considered.

The principles that license the Morning Srar-Evening Srar inference now make
no trouble: they are the usual principles of extensionaliry. fu a result, nothing
now stands in the way of giving a standard theory of meaning for action sen­
tences, in the form of a Tarski-rype truth definicion; nothing stands in the way.
that is, of giving a coherent and constructive account of how the meanings [truth
conditions) of these sentences depend upon their structure. To see how one of
the troublesome inferences now goes through. consider (10) rewritten as

the Morning Scar is an eclipse of the Evening Star. Our ordinary ralk of events, of
causes and effects, requires constant use of the idea ofdifferent descriptions of the
same event. "When it is pointed our that striking the march was nor sufficient to
light it, what is nor sufficient is nor the event, bur the descriprion of it-it was a
dry march, and so on. And of course Kenny's problem of 'variable polyadicity',
though he cakes ic to be a mark of verbs of acrion, is common to all verbs that
describe events.

It may now appear chat the apparent success of the analysis proposed here is
due ro the facr that ic has simply omitted what is peculiar ro acrion sentences as
conrrasred with ocher sentences abour events. Bur 1do nor think so. The concepr
of agency contains two elements, and when we separare them clearly, I think we
shall see that the present analysis has noc lefr anything our. The first of these two
elements we try, rather feebly, to elicit by saying that the agent acts, or does
something, insread of being acted upon, or having something happen ro him. Or
we say that the agent is active rather chan passive; and perhaps try co make nse of
the moods of the verb as a grammatical clue. And we may cry ro depend upon
some fixed phrase like 'brings it abour that' or 'makes it the case that'. Bur only a
lirrle thoughr will make ic clear thac there is no satisfactory grammatical rest for
verbs where we wanr ro say there is agency. Perhaps it is a necessary condition of
attributing agency charone argument-place in the verb is filled wirh a reference ro
the agent as a person; it will nor do to refer ro his body, or his members, or to
anyone else. Bur beyond that it is hard ro go. I sleep, I snore, 1 push buttons,

I recite verses, 1 carch cold. Also others are insulted by the, struck by the, admired
by the, and so on. No grammatical resr I know of, in terms of the things we may
be said to do, of acrive or passive mood, or of any ocher sort, will separare our the
cases here where we want ro speak of agency. Perhaps it is true that 'brings it
about that' guarantees agency; bur as we have seen, many sentences that do
attribute agency cannot be cast in this grammarical form.

I believe the correct ching ro say abour this element in the concepr of agency is
that it is simply introduced by cerrain verbs and nor by others: when we
understand the verb we recognize whether or nor it includes the idea of an agenr.

Thus, 'I fought' and 'I insulred him' do impure agency to the person referred to
by the first singular rerm, 'I caughr cold' and, 'I had my thirceenrh birthday' do
nor. In these cases, we do seem to have the following rest: we impure agency only
where it makes sense ro ask whether the agent acred intentionally. Bur there are
other cases, or so it seems to the, where we impure agency only when the answer
ro the question whether the agent acred inrencionally is 'yes'. If a than falls down
by accident or because a truck knocks him down, we do nor impure agency; bur
we do if he fell down on purpose.

This introduces the second element in checoncepr ofagency, for we surely impure
agency when we say or imply thac the act is intentional. Instead of speaking of two
elements in the concepr of agency, perhaps it would be berrer ro say there are

48

(18) (3x) (Flew(I, my spaceship, x) & Tofrhe Morning Star, x)).

which, along with (11), entails
(19) (3x) (Flew(I, my spaceship, x) & Tofrhe Evening Star, x)).


It is nor necessary, in representing this argument, ro separate off the To-relation:
instead we could have taken, 'Flew' as a four-place predicare. Bur that would have
obscured another inference. namely that from (19) ro
(20) (3x) (Flew(I, my spaceship, x)).


In general, we conceal logical structure when we trear prepositions as integral
parts of verbs; it is a merir of the presem proposal that it suggesrs a way of treating
preposirions as contributing structure. Nor only is it good ro have the inference
from (19) to (20); it is also good ro be able ro keep track of the common element
in <fly ro' and 'Ry away from' and this of course we cannot do if we trear these as
unstructured predicates.

The problem that threatened in Reichenbach's analysis, that there seemed no
clear principle on which ro refrain from applying the analysis ro every sentence,
has a natural solurion if my suggesrion is accepted. Part of what we must learn
when we learn the meaning of any predicare is how many places it has, and whac
sorts of entities the variables thac hold these places range over. Some predicates
nave an event-place, some do nor.

In general, what kinds of predicares do have event-places? Wirhour pursuing
this quesrion very far. I think it is evident that if action predicates do, many
predicares mar have Iicrle relation to action do. Indeed, the problems we have
been mainly concerned with are nor at all unique ro ralk of actions: they are
common ro ralk of events of any kind. An acrion of flying ro the Morning Star is
identical with an action of Rying ro the Evening Star; bur equally, an eclipse of

The Logical Form ofAction Sentences

two ways we can imply that a person acted as an agent: we may use a verb that
implies it directly, or we may use a verb that is non-committal, and add that the
act was intentional But when we rake the second course, it is important not to
trunk of the inreutionaliry as adding an extra doing of the agenr, we must not make
the expression that introduces intention a verb of action. In particular, we cannot
use "intentionally brings it about that' as the expression mar introduces intention,
for 'brings it about mar' is in itself a verb of action, and imputes agency. but it is
neutral with respect to
question whether the action was intentional as described.

This leaves the question what logical form (he expression that introduces
intention should have. It is obvious, I hope. that
adverbial form must be in
some way deceptive; intentional actions are not a class of actions, or, to pm (he
point a little differendy, doing something intentionally is noc a manner of doing
k. To say someone did something intentionally is to describe the action in a way
that bears a special relation co the beliefs and artirudes of the agene; and perhaps
further to describe the action as haviug been caused by those beliefs and
artirudes.!' Bur of course to describe the action of the agenr as having been
caused in a certain way does not mean that the agent is described as performing
any further action. From a logical poinr of view, there are thus these imporranr
conditions governing the expression that introduces intention: it must nor be
interpreted as a verb of action, it must be intensional, and the intention must be
tied to a person. I propose then that we use some form of words like 'It was
intentional of x that p' where 'x' names the agem, and 'p' is a sentence that says
the agent did somerhing. lr is useful, perhaps necessary, that the agenc be named
rwice when we try co make logical form explicit. lr is useful, because it reminds us
that co describe an action as intentional is to describe the action in the lighc of
certain attitudes and beliefs of a particular person; it may be necessary in order co

A. Reply to Lemmon on Tenses. My goal was to gee clear about the logical form of
acrion sentences. By action senrences I mean sentences in En.glish about actions.

Ar the level of abstraction on which the discussion moved, little was said that
would not apply co sentences abour actions in many ocher languages if it applied
to sentences in English. The ideal implicit in the paper is a theory that spells our
every element of logical form in every English sentence about actions. I dream of
a theory that makes the transirion from the ordinary idiom to canonical notation
purely mechanical, and a canonical notation rich enough ro caprure, in its dull
and explicit way, every difference and connection legirimately considered the
business of a theory of meaning. The poinr of canonical norarion so conceived is
not to improve on somerhing left vague and defective in narural language, but to
help elicit in a perspicuous and general form the understanding of logical
grammar we all have that conscirures (part of) our grasp of our native tongue.

In exploring the logical form of sentences about actions and events, I con­
centrated on certain features of such senrences and neglected orhers. One feature

I torally neglected was that of tense; Lemmon is absolutely right in pointing our
mar some of the inferences I consider valid depend (in a standard way we have
become hardened co) on fudging with respect to time. The necessity for fudging
shows that we have failed co bring OUt a feature of logical form.

I accepr the implication that my own account was incomplete through neglect
of the element of cense, and I welcome Lemmon's attempt to remedy the situ­
arion. I am very much in sympathy with the methods he apparently thinks
appropriate. Logicians have almost always assumed thac the demonstrative
element in natural languages necessarily resists serious semantic trearment, and
they have accordingly cried to show how ro replace tensed expressions wirh
ochers containing no demonstrative feature. What recommends this srraregy co
logicians {the elimination of sentences with variable truth-values) also serves co
show that it is not a strategy for analysing the senreuces of English. Lemmon

makes no attempt to eliminate the demonstrative element from his canonical
noracion (subsriruring <before now' for the past tense is a way of articulating the
relation between the different tenses of the same verb, not of eliminating
the demonstrative element). At the same time, he obviously has in mind that
the structure he introduces must lend itself to formal semantic treatment. It is
simply a mistake, Lemmon correctly assumes, to think that senrences with
a demonstrative element resist the application of systematic semantic analysis.

good argument ro show they are; but until one is produced, we must suspend

B. Reply to Lemmon on Identity Condition; for Events. If we are going

to quantify

over evenrs and interpret singular terms as referring to events, we need to say

something about the conditions under which expressions of the form 'a= b' are
true where 'a' and 'h' refer, or purport to refer, co events. This is a difficult and
complex subject, and I do not propose to do more here than comment briefly on
some of Lemmon's remarks. But I think he is right to raise the issue; before we
decide that our general approach to the analysis of event senrences is correct,
there must be much more discussion of the criteria for individuating and
idenrifying events.

Lemmon is surely right that a necessary condirion for the identity of events is
that they rake place over exactly the same period of time. He suggests, very
tentatively, that if we add that the events 'rake the same place', then we have
necessary and sufficient conditions for identity. I am nor ar all certain this
suggestion is wrong, but before we accept it we shall need to remove two doubts.

The first centres on the question whether we have adequate criteria for the
location of an event. As Lemmon realizes, his principle that if R...a,z) then a is a
participant in z, cannot be true for every F (rake 'F' as 'took place a thousand
miles south of' and 'a' as 'New York'; we would not, presumably, say New York
participated in every event that took place a thousand miles south of New York).

And how do we deal with examples like this: if a than's arm goes up, the event
takes place in the space-time zone occupied by the arm; but if a than raises his
arm, doesn't the event fill the zone occupied by the whole than? Yet the events
may be identical. If a than drives his car into his garage, how much of the garage
does the event occupy? All of it, or only the zone occupied by the car? Finally, if
events are to have a location in an interesting sense, we need to see what is wrong
with rue following argument: if an event is a change in a certain object, then
the event occupies ar least the zone occupied by the object during the time the
event takes place. But if one object is part of another, a change in the first is a
change in the second. Since an object is part of the universe, it folloW'S that every
event that is a change in an object rakes place everywhere (rhroughonr the uni­
verse). This argument is, I believe, faulry, but it must be shown to be so before we
can talk intelligibly of the locarion of events.

The second doubr we must remove if we are to identify events with space-rime
zones is that there may be two differenc events in the same zone. Suppose that
during exactly the same rime interval Jones catches cold, swims the Hellespont,

C. &ply to Castatieaa on Agmt and Patient. Castaneda very usefully summarizes
the main points in my paper, and raises some questions abour the principles that
ace implicit in my examples. My lack of explicitness has perhaps misled him in
one respect. It is not part of my programme ro make all entailments matters of
logical form. 'x > y' entails 'y < x', bur not as a marrer of form. 'x is a grand­
farber' entail s 'x is a father', hut not a." :l matter of form. And 1 think there Me
cases where, to use Castaneda's words, 'a larger polyadic action statement entails
a shorter one which is a part of it' and yet this is not a matter of logical form. An
example, perhaps, is this: 'I flew my spaceship' may entail, 'I flew', but if it does,
it is not, I think. because of the logical form of the sentences. My reason for
saying this is that I find no reason ro believe the logical form of 'I flew my
spaceship' differs from that of"I sank the Bismarck', which does not entail 'I sank'
though it does happen to entail 'The Bismarck sank'. A comparison of these
examples oughr ro go a long way ro persuade us that simple sentences containing
transitive verbs do not, as a marrer of logical form, entail sentences with
intransitive verbs. Putting sentences in the passive will nor radically change
things. If I sank the Bismarck. the Bismarce was sunk and the Bismarck sank.

But 'The Bismarck was sunk' and 'The Bismarck sank' are not equivalent, for the
econd does nor entail the first. Thus even if we were to accept Cascafieda's view
that 'The Bismarck was sunk' has a logically intransitive verb, the passivity of the
subject remains a feature of this verb distinguishing it from the verb of 'The

Bismarck sank'. Thus there is no obvious economy in Casrafieda's idea of
indicating the distinction between agent and patient by position in verbs of
action. There would be real merit, however, in keeping track of the relation
between 'The Bismarck was snnk' and 'The Bismarck sank', which is that the first
encails the second; but Castafieda's nocarion does not help with this.

Castaneda would have us put 'The King insulted the Queen' in this form:
(3x) (Insulted (the King, x) & Insulted (x, the Queen)


What is this relation, that relares a person and an event or, in the same way, an
event and a person? 'What logical feature is preserved by this form that is nor as
well preserved, and less misleadingly, by
(3x) (Insulted (the King, x) & Was insulted (the Queen, x))

[i.e., 'There was an event that was an insulnog by the King and of the Queen')?

But I remain unconvinced of the advantages in splirring transitive verbs up in this
way. The gain is the entailment of 'My spaceship was flown' by 'I flew my

was Hown' has been interpreted so as not to email 'Someone flew my
spaceship".'?

problem then looks, even with Casrafieda's revision, much like the problem of
analysing sentences about other propositional attitudes.


S4


D. R£ply to Castaneda on Prepositions. My proposal to treat certain prepositions
as verbs does seem odd, and perhaps it will rum out to be radically mistaken. But

I am not quite convinced of this by what Casrafieda says. My analysis of '1 flew
my spaceship to the Moening Star does entail '(3x) (To (the Moening Stat, xl)',
and Castaneda turns this into words as 'There was a to the Morning Star'. But

I think we can do better: 'There was an event involving motion toward the

Morning Scar' or 'There was an eveut characterized by being to (toward) the

Morning Scar'. Castafieda himself proposes 'flying-to', which shows
he understands the SOrt of verb I have in mind. But of course I don't like 'flying­
co' as an unstructured predicate, since this breaks the connection with 'walking­
co' and its kin. Castaneda complains, of my use of plain 'co', that there are many
different senses ofro'. depending on the verb it is coupled with. Let us suppose
we undecsrand this difficulty, with irs heavy dependence on the concept of
sameness of relation. I shall meet Casrafieda half-way by inrroducing a special
form of 'to' which means, 'motion-toward-and-rerminaring-ar'; this is more
general than his 'flying-to' and less general than my former, plain, 'to'. And

I assume that if Castaneda understands '(3x) (flying-to [the Morning Srar, x»' he
will understand '(3x) (Mocion-towards-and-terminating-at (the Morning Star,
x)', for this verb differs from his merely in degree of generality.


E. Reply to Castaneda on Intention. First Castaneda makes the point, also made
by Lemmon, that I would have done well to make basic a notion of intention that
does not imply that whar is intended is done. I think they ate tight in this.

Castaneda then goes on to claim that my analysis of 'Oedipus intentionally
sought the slayer of Laius' as 'It was intentional of Oedipus that Oedipus sought
the slayer of Laius' is faulty because the first sentence might be true and the
second false if Oedipus failed to know that he was Oedipus. Casrafieda suggests
that to correct the analysis, we should put 'he (himself)' for the second occur­
rence ofOedipus'. In my opinion, Castaneda is right both in his criticism and in
his correction. There is, as he maintains, an irreducibly demonstrative element in
the full analysis of sentences about intentions, and my proposal concealed it.

Perhaps I should remark here that I do not think it solves the problem of the
analysis of sentences about intention to put them in the form of 'It was inren­
rional of x that p '; such. sentences are notoriously hard co bring under a
semantical theory. I view putting such sentences in this form as a first step; the

U On the general poinr raised by Castaneda, whether transirive verhs email their inrrarnicive
counterparrs as a marrer of logical form, and {a related matter} whether passive transformation is a
matter of logical form, I would now side with Casrafieda.

F. Rrply to Chisholm on Making Happen. I am happy to have Chisholm's careful
comments on the section of my paper that deals with his views; he has made the
realize that I had not appreciated the subtlety of his analysis. It is not clear to the
now whether, on the issues discussed in my paper, there is any disagreement
herween us. Let the formulate the questions that remain in my mind as I now
understand them.

I assume that since he has not attempted an analysis of event sentences gen­
erally, and the p'in, 'He made it happen that p'refers to an event, Chisholm does
nor dispute my claim that he has not solved the main problems with which I deal
in my paper. The question is rather whether there are any special problems in his
analysis of action and agency. The first difficulty I raised for Chisholm was
whether he could produce, in a reasonably mechanical way, for every sentence of
the form 'He raised his arm' or 'Alice broke the mirror', another sentence of the
form 'He made it happen that p' or 'Alice made it happen that r' where
does
not have the agent as subject. Chisholm shows, I think, that there is a chance he
can handle 'He raised his arm' and 'Alice broke the mirror' except, perhaps, in
the case where intention is not involved at all, and this is not under discussion.

The cases I would now worry about are rather 'He walked to the corner', 'He
carved the roast', 'He fell down', or 'The doctor removed the patient's appendix',

In each. of these examples I find I am puzzled as to what the agent makes happen.

My problem isn't that I can't imagine that there is some bodily movement that
the agent might be said to make happen, bur that I see no way automatically to
produce the right description from the original senrence. No doubt each time a
than walks to the corner there is some way he makes his body move; but of course
it does not follow that there is some one way he makes his body move every rime
he walks to the corner.

The second difficulty I raised for Chisholm concerned the question whether
his analysis committed him to 'acts of the will', perhaps contrary to his own
intentions. It is clear that Chisholm does not want to be committed to acts of the
will, and that his analysis does not say that there are acts of the will but I believe
the question can still be raised. It can be raised by asking whether the event said
to occur in <Jones made it happen chat his arm went up' is the same event or a
different one from the event said to occur in 'Jones's arm Went up'. Ir seems to
the Chisholm can avoid acts of the will only by saying the events are the same. He
is free to say this, of course, and then the only objection is terminological. And
'Jones's arm went up' would then be, when it was something Jones made happen,
a description of an acrion.

At the end of his reply, Chisholm conjectures that I may nor agree with him
that agents may be causes. Actually I See no objection to saying that agents are
causes, but I think we understand this only when we can reduce it to the case of

'I

an event being a cause; and here I do disagree with Chisholm. He asks how we
are to render 'He made it happen that p' in terms merely of relations among
events. If the problem is that of giving the logical form of action sentences, then

I have made a suggestion in
present paper. If the problem is to give an analysis
of the concept of agency using other concepts, then I am not sure it can be done.

Why must it be possible?

rather the doings and havings of relations and properties of those objects; in two
words, the facts. It Seems that a fact contains, in appropriate array, just the objects
any sentence it verifies is about. No wonder we may not be satisfied with the
colourless 'corresponds to' for the relation between a true sentence and irs face;
there is something, we may feel, to be said for 'is true to', 'is faithful to', or even
'pictures'.

To specify a fact is, then, a way of explaining what makes a sentence true. On
the other hand, simply to say that a sentence is true is to say there is some fact or
other to which it corresponds. On this account, is true to (or corresponds to)
the facts' means more literally corresponds to a fact'. Just as we can say there is a
fact to which a sentence corresponds when the sentence is true, we can also say
there is a true sentence corresponding to a particular fact; this larter comes down
to saying of the facr that it is one. English sentences that perhaps express this idea
are 'That the cat has mange is a fact' and 'It is a fact that London is in Canada',
and even 'London is in Canada, and that's a fact.' It is evident that we must
distinguish here between idioms of at least two sorts, those that attribute fact­
hood to an entity (a facr), and those that say of a sentence that it corresponds to a
fact (or 'the facts'). Let us use the following sentences as our samples of the two
sorts of idiom:

56

the


G. Reply to Martin. There is a more or less innocent sense in which we say that a
sentence refers co, describes, or is about, some enriry when the sentence contains
a singular term that refers to that entity. Speaking in this vein, we declare that,
'The cat has mange' refers to the cat, 'Caesar's death was broughr on by a cold'
describes Caesar and his death, and 'Jack fell down and broke his crown' is about

Jack and Jack's crown. Observing how the reference of a complex singular term
like 'Caesar's death' or 'Jack's crown' depends systematically on the reference of
the contained singular term ('Caesar' or 'Jack') it is tempting co go on co ask what
a sentence asa whole is about (or refers co, or describes), since it embraces singular
terms like 'Caesar's dearh' in much the way 'Caesar's death' embraces 'Caesar'.

There is now a danger of ambiguity in the phrases 'what a sentence refers co' or
'what a sentence is about': let us resolve it by using only 'refers co' for the relation
between patent singular terms and what they are about, and only 'corresponds co'
for the relation between a sentence and whar it is about.

Just as a complex singular rerm like 'Caesar's death' may fail of reference
though contained singular terms do not, so a sentence may not correspond ro
anything, even though its contained singular terms refer; wiruess 'Caesar's death
was brought on by a cold'. Clearly enough, it is JUSt the true sentences that have a
corresponding entity; 'The cat has mange' corresponds to the eat's having of
mange, which alone can make it true; because there is no entity that is Caesar's
death having been brought on by a cold, 'Caesar's death was broughr on by a
cold' Is not true.t't

These gerunds can get to be a bore, and we have a way around them in 'fact
that' clauses. The entity to which 'The cat has mange' corresponds is the eat's
having of mange; equivalently, it is the face that the cat has mange. Quite generally
we get a singular term for the entity to which a sentence corresponds by prefixing
'the face that' co the sentence; assuming, of course, there are such entities.

Philosophical inreresr in facts springs partly from their promise for explaining
truth. It's clear that most sentences would not have the truth value they do if the
world were not the way it is, but what in the world makes a sentence true? Not
just the objects to which a sentence refers (in the sense explained above), bur
14 For simpliciry's sake I speak as if truth were a propeny of sentences; more properly if is a
relation berween a sentence, a person and a lime. (We could equally think of truth as a property of
utterances, of tokens, or of speech acts.} l assurne here that when truth is anribured to a sentence, or

(I) That the cat has mange is a fact,
(2) The sentence, 'The car has mange' corresponds to a fact.

Professor Martin says his analysis is intended to apply to sentences of the form
'So-and-so is a fact' where I suppose 'so-and-so' is to be replaced, typically. by a
that-clause, and he suggests we interpret such sentences as saying of a sentence
that it is true {non-analytically-c-but [shall ignore this twist). Which of the two
idioms represented by (1) and (2) is Marrin analysing? The senrences Marrin says
he wants to analyse apparently have the form of (1); his analysis, on the other
hand, seems suited to sentences like (2).

Suppose we tty the second rack. Then Martin's proposal comes to this: where
we appear to say of a sentence that there is a fact to which it corresponds we
might as well say simply that the sentence is true. There is nothing in this yet to
offend the most devoted friend of facts. Marrin has not explained. away a singular
term that ever purported to refer to a fact; On his analysis, as on the one the friend
of facts would give, the only singular term in, 'The sentence "The cat has mange"
corresponds to the facts' refers to a sentence. Nor would the friend of faces want
to deny the equivalence of is true' and 's corresponds to a face' when's' is
replaced by the name or description of a sentence. The friend of facts would,
however, balk at the claim that this shows how, in general, to eliminate quan­
tification over facts, or singular terms that refer to them. He would contend that
it is only sentence (1) with irs apparent singular term 'that the cat has mange'
which clearly calls for an ontology of facts. Martin may reply that it is sentence

this idea. and plausibly, I think, on the ground that (2) is merely an existential

and 'fact' as synonyms, or so he says.t? The pressure to treat events as facts is easy,
in a way, co understand: both offer themselves as what senrences-c-sorne sentence
at ieasr-c-reter to or are about. Causal laws, we are cold, say that every event of a
certain sort is followed by an event of another SOft. According to Hempel, the
sentence, 'The length of copper rod r increased between 9.00 and 9.01 a.m.'
describes a particular evenr.w In philosophical discussion of action these days we
very often learn such things as that 'Jones raised his arm' and 'Jones signalled'
may describe the same action, or that an age-or may perform an action inren­
rionally under one description and not under another. It is obvious that most of
the sentences usually said to be about events contain no singular terms that even
appear to refer to events, nor are they normally shown to have variables that rake
events as values when put over into ordinary quantificarional noration. The
natural conclusion is that sentences as wholes describe or refer to events, JUSt as
they were said to correspond as wholes to facts, and this. as we have seen, must he
wrong.

Marrin does not fall inro this common trap, for although he COnstructs singular
rerrns for events from the marerial of a senrence, he does nor have the sentence
itself refer ro an event. His procedure is to view an event as an ordered a-tuple
made up of the extensions of the n - I singular terms and the n - l vplace pre­
dicate of a true sentence. So, 'Leopold mer Stephen on Bloomsday' gives us the

Bloomsday provided Leopold did meet Srephen on Bloomsday. [ shall ignore the
further step by which Martin eliminates ordered e-ruples in favour of virtual
ordered e-rupies: the difficulties about to appear are independent of that idea.>'

Given the premise that Bloomsday is 16 June 1904, we may infer from,
'Leopold mer Stephen on Bloomsday' the sentence, 'Leopold mer Stephen on 16

June 1904', and, events being the ordered. x-ruples they are, Leopold's meeting of

Stephen on Bloomsday is identical with Leopold's meeting of Stephen on 16

June 1904. This is surely as it should be so far; bur not, I'm afraid, farther. Nor
every encounter is a meeting; according to the Story, some encounters between

Leopold and Stephen are meetings and some are not. But then by Martin's
account no meeting is identical with an encounter, though between the same
individuals and at the same time. The reason is that if any encounter IS not a
meeting, (E, I, s, b) is not idenrical with (M, l; s, b). Indeed, Leopold's first
mccring with Stephen on Bloomsday in Dublin cannot be identical with

Leopold's first meeting with Stephen on Bloomsday (since a fourplace predicate
can't have the same extension as a three-place predicate); nor can a meeting
between Stephen and Bloom be identical with a meeting bcrween Bloom and

Stephen (since entities will be ordered in a different way). No stabbing can be a

(3) The sentence, 'The cat has mange' corresponds to the face that the cat has
mange.

Here Martin's attempt

to

treat faces as sentences cannot be made co work without

reducing (3) co the statement that the sentence, 'The cat has mange' corresponds
to itself, and this cannot be right since (3), like (2), is clearly srmantical in

character; it relates a sentence

to

the world. Martin recognizes the semantic thrusr

in calk of faces, but docs uot notice that it cannot be reconciled with his analysis

of (I).

Marrin's thesis chat we do not need an oncology of faces could still be saved by
an argument co show that there is at most one facr, for the interest in raking
sentences like (3) as containing singular terms referring to facts depends on the

assumption that there is an indefinitely large number of different facts to be
referred ro: if there were only one, we could submerge reference to it into what
might as well be considered a one-place predicate. IS And an argument is handy,
thanks to F rege, showing that if sentences refer ar all, all true sentences must refer
to the same thing.'?

We may then with easy conscience side with Marrin in viewing 'corresponds to
a face", when said of a sentence, as conveying no more than 'is true'. What should
we say of the senrences like (1) that appear to attribute facrhood to entities? As we
have seen, such sentences cannot be analysed as being about sentences. Bearing in
mind the unity of fact, we might say (l ) affirms The Grear Fact, or tells The

Truth, byway of one of its infiniry of rags, 'The car has mange.' We could equally
well accept the universe with 'Thar London is in Canada is a fact.' Equivalently,
we could have sim ply said, 'London is in Canada.' So, on my accounr, 'The
sentence "The car has mange" corresponds to the faces' corncs our 'The sentence
"The car has mange" is true', but 'That the cat has mange is a fact' comes out just
'The cat has mange'; nor at all the same thing. I?

It is often assumed or argued (rhongh nor by Marrin) that events are a species
of fact. Austin, fat example, says, 'Phenomena, events, situations, states of affairs
are commonly supposed to be genuinely-in-the-world.... Yet surely of all these
we can say that they are filets. The collapse of the Germans is an event and is a

killing and no killing can be a murder, no arm-raising a signalling, and no
birthday party a celebration. I protest.

Marcin's conditions on identity of events are clearly not necessary, bur are they
perhaps sufficient! Again I think
answer is no. Marrin correcdy remarks
on his analysis the expressions that are supposed to refer co events refer to one
enriry at most; bur are these entities the events they should be? Suppose Leopold
met Stephen more than once on Bloomsday; what unique meeting does Marrin's
ordered a-tuple pick our? 'Leopold's meeting with Stephen on Bloomsday', like

Marcin's <{M, I, s, b)', is a true singular term. But there is this difference, that the
first refers co a meeting if it refers co anything, while (he second does nor. Being
more specific about time will nor really mend matters: John's kissing of a girl at
precisely noon is not a unique kissing if he kissed two girls simultaneously.

Marrin's method cannot be systematically applied to form singular terms guar­
anteed to pick out a particular kissing, marriage, or meering if anything; but this
is easy, with gerund phrases, in English.

Martin's mistake is natural, and it is connected with a basic confusion abour
the relation between a sentence like 'Leopold met Stephen on Bloomsday' or
'Caesar died' and particular events like Leopold's meeting with Stephen on

Bloomsday or Caesar's death. The mistake may be encapsulated in the idea
(common to Martin and many others) that 'Leopold met Stephen on Blooms­
day' comes to the same as 'Leopold's meeting with Stephen on Bloomsday
occurred' or that 'Caesar died' may be rendered 'Caesar's death took place'.
'Caesar's death', like 'Leopold's meeting with Stephen', is a true singular term,
and so 'Caesar's death rook place' and 'Leopold's meeting with Srephen
occurred' are true only if there was just one such meeting or death. But 'Caesar
died' is true even if Caesar died a thousand deaths, and Leopold and Stephen may
meet as often as they please on Bloomsday without falsifying 'Leopold met

Stephen on Bloomsday.'

A sentence such as 'Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79' no more refers to an individual
event than There's a By in here' refers to an individual By. Of course there may
be JUSt one emption that verifies the first sentence and just one By that verifies the
second; but that is beside the point. The point is that neither sentence can
properly be interpreted as referring or describing, or being about, a particular
eruption or By. No singular term for such is in the offing. 'There's a By in here' is
existential and general with respect to flies in here; 'Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79'
is existential and general with respect to eruptions of Vesuvius in A.D. 79-if
there are such things as eruptions, of course.

Here I am going along wirh Ramsey who, in a passage quoted by Martin,
wrote, "That Caesar died" is really an existential proposition, asserting the
existence of an event of a certain sort, thus resembling "Italy has a King", which
asserts the existence of a than of a certain sorr. The event which is of that sort is
called the dearh of Caesar, and should no more be confused with the fact that

Caesar died than the King of Iraly should be confused wirh the fact that Italy has

the

that

61

a King. '22 This seems to the nearly exactly right: facts, if such there are, corres­
pond to whole sentences, while events, if such there are, correspond to singular
terms like 'Caesar's death', and are quantified over in sentences such as 'Caesar
died.'23

Martin says he doubts that 'Caesar died' must, or perhaps even can, be con­
strued as asserting the existence of an event of a certain sort. I want to demon­
strate briefly first that it can, and then, even more briefly, why I think it must.

It can be done by providing event-verbs with one more place than we generally
think necessary, a place for events. I propose that 'died' in 'Caesar died' be taken
as a two-place predicate, one place for 'Caesar' and another for a variable ranging
over events. The sentence as a whole then becomes '(3x) (Died (Caesar, x))', that
is, there ex.isrs a Caesar-dying event, or there exists an event that is a dying of

Caesar. There is no problem in forming a singular term like 'Caesar's death' from
these materials: it is '(IX) (Died (Caesar, x))'. We may then say truly, though this
is nor equivalent co 'Caesar died', that Caesar died JUSt once: '(3y) (y= (IX) (Died
(Caesar, x)))'; we may even say Caesar died Caesar's death: 'Died (Caesar, (IX)
(Died (Caesar, x)))'.

This gives us Some idea what it would be like to treat events seriously as
individuals, with variables ranging over them, and with corresponding singular
terms. It is clear, I think, that none of the objections I have considered to

Reichenbach's, Kim's, or Marrin's analyses apply to the present snggesrion. We
could introduce an ontology of events in this way, bur of course the question
remains whether there is any good reason to do so. I have already mentioned
some of the contexts, in (he analysis of action, of explanation, and of causality in
which we seem to need to talk of events; still, faced with a basic ontological
decision, we might well try to explain the need as merely seeming. There remains
however a clear problem that is solved by admitting events, and that has no other
solution I know of.

The problem is simple, and ubiquitous. It can be illustrated by pointing Out
that 'Brutus stabbed Caesar in the back in the Forum with a knife' entails 'Brutus
stabbed Caesar in the back in the Forum' and both these entail 'Brutus stabbed

Caesar in the back' and all these entail 'Brutus stabbed Caesar'; and yet OUr
common way of symbolizing these sentences reveals no logical connection. It
may be thought the needed entailments could be supplied by interpreting 'Brutus
stabbed Caesar' as elliptical for 'Brurus stabbed Caesar somewhere (in Caesar)
somewhere (in the world) with something', but this is a general solution only if
we know some fixed number of places for the predicate 'stabbed' large enough to

accommodate all evenrualities. It's unlikely we shall succeed, for a phrase like 'by'
can introduce an indefinitely large number of modifications, as in 'He hung the
picture by putting a nail in the wall, which in turn he did by hitting the nail with
a hammer. which in turn he did by... .'24 Intuitively, there is no end to what we
can say about the causes and consequences ofevents, our theory of language has
gone badly astray if we must treat each adverbial modification as introducing a
new place into a predicate. The problem, you can easily persuade yourself, is not
peculiar to verbs of action.

My proposed analysis of sentences with event-verbs solves this difficulty, for
once we have events to talk about, we can say as much or as little as we please
about them. Thus the troublesome sentence becomes (not in symbols, and not
quite in English); 'There exists an event that is a stabbing of Caesar by Brutus
event, it is an into the back of Caesar event, it took place in the Forum, and

Brutus did it with a knife.' The wanted entailments now go through as a matter
of form.

Before we enthusiastically embrace an ontology ofevents we will want to think
long and hard about the criteria for individuating them. I am myself inclined to
think we can do as well for events generally as we can for physical objects
generally (which is not very well), and can do much better for sorts of everus.Iike
deaths and meetings, just as we can for sorts of physical objects, like tables and
people. But all this must wair. 2 S Meanwhile the siruarion seems to the to be this:
there is a lot of language we can make systematic sense of if we suppose
events exist, and we know no promising alternative. The presumption lies with
events.


H. Reply to Cargile. I suggested that sentences about events and actions be
construed as requiring an ontology of particular, unrepeacable, dated events.

For example. I argued that a sentence like <Lucifer fell' has the logical form of
an existential quantification of an open sentence true of falls of Lucifer, the
open sentence in turn consisting of a two-place predicate true of ordered pairs
of things and their falls, and the predicate places filled with a proper name
['Lucifer") and a free variable (bound by the quantifier]. [ did not explain in
derail what I meant by logical form, though I did devote some paragraphs to
the subject. I suppose I thought the problems set, the examples and counter­
examples offered, the arguments given and the answers entertained would,
taken wich the tradition and my hints, make the idea clear enough. I was
wrong; and in retrospect I sympathize with my misundersranders. I will try to
do better.

Logical form was invented to contrast with something else mar is held to be
apparent but mere: the form we are led to assign to sentences by superficial
analogy or traditional grammar. What meets the eye or ear in language has the

charm, complexity, convenience, and deceir of other conventions of the market
place, but underlying it is the solid currency ofa plainer, duller structure, without
wit but also without pretence. This true coin, the deep structure, need never
feature directly in the transactions of real life. As long as we know how to redeem
our paper we can enjoy the benefits of credit.

The image may help explain why the distinction between logical form and
surface grammar can flourish without anyone ever quite explaining it. But what
can we say to Someone who wonders whether there is really any gold in the
vaults! I think the concept oflogical form can be clarified and thus defended; bur
the account I shall offer disclaims some of what is implied by the previous
paragraph.
wrhat do we mean when we ~ay that 'W'halcs arc mammals' is a quantified
sentence? James Cargile suggests that the sentence is elliptical for 'All whales are
mammals' (or 'Some whales are mammals') and once the ellipsis is mended we
see that the sentence is quantified. Someone interested in logical form would, of
course, go much further: he would maintain that 'All whales are mammals' is a
universally quantified conditional whose antecedent is an open sentence true of
whales and whose consequent is an open sentence true of mammals. The contrast
with surface grammar is striking. The subject-predicate analysis goes by the
board, 'all whales' is no longer neared as a unit, and the role of 'whales' and of
'mammals' is seen, or claimed. to he predicarive.

What can justify this astonishing theory? Part of the answer-the part with
which we are most familiar-is that inference is simplified and mechanized when

We rewrite sentences in Some standardized notation. If we want to deduce 'Moby

Dick is a mammal' from 'All whales are mammals' and 'Moby Dick lS a whale',
we need ro connect the predicate 'is a whale' in some systematic way with a
suitable feature of 'All whales are mammals'. The theory of the logical form of
this sentence tells us how.

Words for temporal precedence. like 'before' and 'after', provide anomer
example. 'The inflation came after the war' is simple enough, at least if we accept
events as entities, but how abouc 'Earwicker slept before Shem kicked Shaun'?

Here (before' connects expressions with the gramrnarical form of sentences. How
is this 'before' related to the one that stands between descriptions of events? Is it a
sentential connective, like 'and'? 'Earwicker slept before Shem kicked Shaun'
does entail both 'Earwicker slept' and 'Shem kicked Shaun'. Yet clearly 'before' is
not truth-functional, since reversing the order of the sentences does not preserve
truth.

The solution proposed by Frege has been widely (if not universally) accepted; it
is, as we all know, co think of our sentence as doubly quantified by existential
quantifiers, to introduce extra places into the predicates to accommodate variables
ranging Over rimes, and to interpret 'before' as a two-place predicate. The result,
roughly, is: 'There exist two times, t and u, such that Earwicker slept at t, Shem
kicked Shaun at u, and I was before' u.' This analysis relates the two uses ofbefore',

and it explains why 'Earwicker slept before Shern kicked Shaun' entails 'Shern
kicked Shaun'. It does this, however, only by attributing to 'Shem kicked Sbaun'
the following form: 'There exists a tsuch that Shem kickedShaun ar t. 'According to


Seen in this light, to call the paraphrase of a sentence inro some standard first­
order quanrificational form the logical form of the sentence seems arbitrary
indeed. Quanrificacion theory has its celebrared merits, ro be sure: it is powerful,
simple, consistent, and complete in its way. Not least, there are more or less
standard techniques for paraphrasing many sentences of narural languages inro
quanrihcational languages, which helps excuse nor making the relativity to a
theory explicit. Still, the relariviry remains.

Since there is no eliminating the relariviry of logical form ro a background
theory, the only way to justify particular claims about logical form is by showing
that they fir senrences inca a good theory, at least a theory better than known
alternatives. In calling quanrificarional form logical form I was assuming, like
many others before the, that quantification theory is a good theory. What's so
good about it?

Well, we should nor sneeze at the virtues mentioned above, its
known consistency and completeness (in the sense that all quantihcational truths
are provable). Cargile takes the ro rask for criricizing Reichenbach's analysis of
senrences about events, which introduces an operaror that, when prefixed to a
sentence, results in a singnlar rerm referring ro an event. I givc a standard
argument to show that on this analysis, if one keeps suhstirutiviry of idenriry and
a simple form of exrensionaliry, all events collapse inro one. r concluded, 'This
demonstrates, I think, that Reichenbach's analysis is radically defective'. Cargile
protescs that Reichenbach gets in no trouble if the assumption of exrensionaliry
is abandoned; and the assumption is mine, nor Reichenbach's. Fair enough;

I ought nor to have said the analysis was defective, bur rather that on a narnral
assumption there was a calamitous consequence. Wirhour the assumption there
is no such consequence; but also no theory. Standard quantification theory plus

Reichenbach's theory of event sentences plus suhstitutiviry ofidenciry in the new
contexts leads to collapse of all events inro one. Reichenbach indirectly commits
himself to the principle of subsritutiviry, and Cargile goes along explicirly. So
they are apparently committed co giving up srandard quanrificarion theory. Since
neither offers a substitute, it is impossible to evaluate the posirion.sc

Cargile has another idea, which is nor ro ramper with quantification theory,
bur simply to add some exrra rules to it. If we give the quannficarional form of
'Jones buttered the toast in the bathroom as 'Bunered, (Jones, the roast, the
bathroom)' and of <Jones buttered the roast' as 'Burrered- (Jones, the toast)' then
the inference from the first to the second is no longer a matter of quanrificarional
logic; bur why not inrerprcr this as showing that quanrificarional form isn't
logical form, and quanrificationallogic isn't all of logic? Cargile suggesrs that we
mighr be able ro give a purely formal (syntactical) rule that would sysrcmarize
these inferences. I think Cargile underestimates the difficulties in doing this,

Cargile. nor even Russell would have denied that kickedy'is a two-place relation
form; but Russell had the same motive Frege did for holding chat 'kicked' has the
logical form ofa three-place predicate.

The logical form that the problem of 'before' prompts us to assign ro 'Shem
kicked Shaun' and to its pam is the very form I suggested, though my reasons were
somewhat different, and the oncology was different. So far as onrology is con­
cerned, [he two proposals may to advantage be merged, for we may chink of
'before' and 'after' as relating events as easily as rimes. For mosr purposes,

if nor all.

times are like lengchs-c-conveniem abstractions with which we can dispense in
favour of the concrera that have them. A significant bonus from [his analysis of
sentences of temporal priority is that singular causal senrences can then be nat­
urally related to them. According to Hume, if x caused j, then x preceded y. What
are the entities these variables range over? Events, to be sure. But ifthis answer is to
be taken seriously, then a sentence like 'Sandy's rocking the boat caused it co sink'
must somehow refer to events. Ir does, if we analyse it along these lines: 'There
exist two events, e andf, such that r is a rocking of the boat by SandY,fis a sinking
of the boat, and e caused f'

Ler us suppose, as Cargile seems willing to do, that I am right to this extent: by
rewriting or rephrasing certain sentences inro sentences that explicitly refer to or
quantify over events, we can conveniently represent the enrailmenr relations
between the original sentences. The entailments we preanalytically recognize to
hold between the original sentences become matters of quantificarional logic
applied to their rephrasals. And now Cargile asks: how can this projecr. assuming
it to be successfully carried out, justify the claim that the original senrences have
the logical form of their rewrites? Why not admit that the rewrites show, in many
cases, a different form?

Here we have, I hope, the makings ofa reconciliation, for I am happy ro admit
that much of the interest in logical form comes from an interest in logical
geography: to give the logical form of a sentence is ro give its logical location in
the roraliry of sentences, to describe it in a way that explicitly determines what
sentences it entails and what sentences it is entailed by. The locarion must be
given relative ro a specific deductive theory; so logical form itself is relarive ro a
theory. The relatively does nor stop here, eicher, since even given a theory of
deduction there may be more chan one total scheme for interprering the sen­
rences we are interested in and mar preserves che partern of entailments. The
logical form of a particular sentence is, then, relative both ro a theory of
deduction and to some prior determinations as ro how ro render sentences in the
language of the theory.

particularly if. as I have argued. such an approach forces US to adrnir predicates
with indefinitely large numbers of predicate places. I also think he slights the
difference, in his remark chat 'the standard symbolism of quantification theory is
nOC good at keeping track of entailments between relational forms in English'.
between simple axioms (which are all that are needed co keep track of the
entailments between relational forms in. say. a theory of measurement] and new
rules of inference (or axiom schemata). Bur harping on the difficulties, unless they
can be proven to be impossibilities, is inconclusive. lt will be more instructive co
assume chat we are presented with a satisfactory deductive system that adds to
quantification theory rules adequate co implement the entailments between event
sentences of the SOft under consideration. Whar could then be said in defence of
my analysis?

What can be said comes down ro this: it explains more, and it explains better.
lr explains more in the obvious sense of bringing more clara under fewer rules.

Given my account of the form of sentences about evenrs and actions, certain
entailments are a matrer of quantificarionallogic: an accounr of the kind Cargile
hopes ro give requires quanrificarionallogic, and then some. Bur there is a deeper
difference.

We catch sighr of the further difference if we ask ourselves why 'Jones buttered
the roast in the bathroom' en rails 'Jones buttered the roast'. So far, Cargile's only
answer is, because 'buttered' and some orher verbs (lisred or characterized
somehow) work that way; and my only answer is, because (given my paraphrases)
it follows from the rules of quantification theory. Bur now suppose we ask, why
do the rules endorse this inference? Surely it has something to do with the facr
mar "buttered' rums up in both sentences? There must be a common conceptual
element represented by this repeated syntactic feature, we would have a clue co it,
and hence a better understanding of the meaning of the two sentences, if we
could say what common role 'buttered' has in the two sentences. Bur here it is
evident mar Cargile's rules, if they were formulated, would be no help. These
rules near the fact mar the word 'buttered' rurns up in both senrences as an
accident: the rule would work as well if unrelated words were used for the two­
and for the three-place ptedicares. In the analysis I have proposed, the word
'buttered' is discovered. to have a common role in the two sentences: in both cases
it ls a predicate satisfied by certain ordered triples of agents, things buttered, and
events. So now we have the beginnings of a new sort of answer to the question
why one of our sentences entails the other: it depends on the fact that the word
'burcered' is playing a certain common role in born sentences. By saying exactly
what the role is, and whar the roles of the orner significanr fearures of the
sentences are, we will have a deep explanation of why one senrence enrails the
other, an explanarion mar draws on a systemaric accounr of how the meaning of
each senrence is a hmcrion of irs srrucrure.

To exhibir an enrailmenr as a marrer of quanrificational form is ro explain it
bener because we do nor need (0 rake the rules of quanrificarLonallogic on faim;

we can show that they are valid, i.e., truth-preserving, by giving an accounr of the
conditions under which sentences in quantificationai form are true. From such
an account (a theory of truth satisfying Tarski's criteria) it can be seen that if
certain sentences are true, others must be. The rules of quantificational logic
are justified when we demonstrate mar from truths they can lead only to truths.

Plenry of inferences that some might call logical cannot be shown ro be valid in
any interesting way by appeal to a theory of truth, for example the inference to 'a
is larger than c ' from 'a is larger than band b is larger than c' or to 'Henry is nor
a than' from 'Henry is a frog'. Clearly a recursive accounr of truth can ignore
these entailments simply by ignoring the logical features of the particular pre­
dicares involved. Bur if I am right. it may nor be possible to give a coherent
theory of truth mar applies to sentences abour events and that does nor validate
the adverbial inferences we have been discussing.

Ler the scare in more detail how I think our sample inference can be shown to
be valid. On my view, a theory of truth would email that 'Jones buttered the roast
in the bathroom' is true if and only if there exists an event satisfying these two
condirions: it is a buttering of the roasr by Jones, and it occurred in the barh­
room. Bur if these conditions are satisfied, then there is an event that is a bur­
rering of the roast by Jones, and this is just what musr be the case, according to
the theory, ifjones buttered the roast' is true. I pur the matter this way because it
seems to the possible that Cargae may agree with what I say, then adding, 'Bur
how does chis show that "Jones buttered the roasr'' is a three-place predicate?' If
this is his response, our troubles are over, or anyway are merely verbal, for all

I mean by saying that 'Jones buttered the toast' has the logical form of an
existentially quantified senrence, and that 'buttered' is a three-piece predicate, is
that a theory of truth meering Tarski's criteria would entail mar this senrence is
rrue if and only if there exists ... etc. By my lighrs, we have given the logical form
of a sentence when we have given the truth-conditions of the sentence in the
context of a theory of truth mar applies to the language as a whole. Such a theory
must identify some finite stock of truth-relevant elements, and explicitly account
for the truth-conditions of each sentence by how these elements feature in it: so
to give the logical form of a sentence is to describe it as composed of the elements
the theory isolates.

These remarks will help, I hope, to pur talk of'paraphrasing' or 'translating' in
irs place. A theory of truth entails, for each sentence s of the object language, a
theorem of the form 's is true if and only ifp '. Since the sentence that replaces 'p'
must be true (in the metalanguage) if and only if sis true (in the object lauguagc),
there is a sense in which the sentence that replaces 'p 'may be called a translation
of s; and if the meralanguage contains the objecr language, it may be called a
paraphrase. (These claims musr be modified in imporram ways in a meory of
rrurh for a namral language.) Bur it should be emphasized that paraphrasis
or translation serves no purpose here excepr that of giving a sysrematic aCCOUnr

Ie should now be clear that my only reason for 'rendering' or 'paraphrasing'
event sentences into quantihcational form was as a way of giving
truth­
conditions for those sentences within a going theory of truth. We have a clear
semantics for first-order quantificarionallanguages, and so if we CU1 see how to
paraphrase senrences in a natural language into quanrificarional form, we see
how to extend a theory of tturh co those sentences. Since the entailments that
depend on quanrificarional form can be completely formalized, it is an easy test
of our success in capruring logical form within a theory of [rum to see whether
our paraphrases articulate the enrailrnenrs we independently recognize as due
co form.

To give the logical form of a sentence is, then, for the, co describe it in rerms
that bring it within the scope of a semantic theory that meers clear requirements.

Merely providing formal rules of inference, as Cargile suggests, thus fails co couch
the question of logical form (except by generalizing some of the data a theory
must explain); showing how co puc sentences into quanrificarional form, on the
other hand, does place them in the context of a semantic theory. The contrast is
stark, for it is the contrast between having a theory, and hence a hypothesis about
logical form, and having no theory, and hence no way of making sense of claims
about form. Bur of course this does nor show mac a theory based on first-order
quanrificarional structure and irs semantics is all we need or can have. Many
philosophers and logicians who have worked on the problem of event sentences
(nor co mention modalities, sentences about propositional arrirudes, and so on)
have come to the conclusion that a richer semantics is required, and can be
provided. In Essay 2 above, I explicitly pur to one side several obvious problems
ehar invite appeal to such richer schemes. For various reasons I thoughr, or
hoped, mac the problem I isolared could be handled within a fairly ausrere
scheme. But when other problems are also emphasized, it may well be mac my
simple proposal loses irs initial appeal; at least the theory must be augmented,
and perhaps it will have co be abandoned.

Cargile thinks that instead ofsuggesting that 'Shem kicked Shaun' has a logical
form that is made mote explicit by '(3x) (Kicked (Shern, Shaun, x»)' I ought (at
most) to have said mac the CWo sentences are logically equivalent (bur have
different logical forms). He makes an analogous point in defending Reichenbach
against my strictures. I want co explain why I resist this adjustment.

Of course it can happen that two sentences are logically equivalent, yec have
different logical forms; for example a sentence with the logical form of a con­
junction is logically equivalent co the conjunction which rakes the conjuncts in
reverse order. Here we assume the theory gives the truth-conditions of each

sentence, and it will be possible co prove mac one sentence is true if and 0 nly if
the other is. Bur the theory doesn't independently supply truth-conditions for
'Shem kicked Shaun' and its canonical counterpart; ramer the larrer gives (or, in
the present discussion, is used ro suggest) the truth conditions of the former.

If the theory were turned on itself as well it might be, the sentence used to
give the truth-conditions of '(3x) (Kicked (Shern, Shaun, x»)' would have the
same form as this sentence; under some natural conditions, it would be this
sentence. So there is no way within the theory ofassigning different logical forms
to 'Shem kicked Shaun' and its explicitly quanrificarional stand-in. Outside a
theory, the notion of logical form has no clear application, as we have noted.

That the two senrences have very different syntactical structures is evident; that is
why the claim that the logical form is the same is interesting and, if correct,
revealing.

Suppose that a rule of inference is added to our logic, making each of the two
sentences deducible from the other. (Reichenbach may have had this in mind: see

Elements of57mbo!;c Logic, § 48.) Will this then make it possible to hold that the
sentences have different logical forms? The answer is as before: rules of inference
that are not backed by a semantic theory are irrelevant to logical form.

I would like co mention very briefly anomer point on which Cargile may have
misunderstood the. He says that, 'The idea that philosophical "analysis" consists
in this revealing of logical form is a popular one ... ' and he may mink I share this
notion. I don't, and I said that I didn't on the first page of the article he discusses.

Even if philosophical analysis were concerned only with language (which I do not
believe), revealing logical form would be only part of the enterprise. To know the
logical form of a sentence is to know, in the Context of a comprehensive theory,
the semantic roles of the significant features of the sentence. Aside from the
logical constants, this knowledge leaves us ignorant of the relations between
predicates, and of their logical properties. To know the logical form of 'The rain
caused the flood' is to know whether 'caused' is a sentential connective or a two­
place predicate (or something else), but it hardly begins to be knowledge of an
analysis of the concept of causaliry (or the word 'caused'). Or perhaps it is the
beginning; bur mac is all.

On the score of oncology, too, the study oflogical form can carry us onJy a
certain distance. If I am right, we cannot give a satisfactory account of the
semantics of certain sentences without recognizing that if any of those sentences
are true. mere must exist such things as events and actions. Given this much, a
study of event sentences will show a great deal about what we assume to be true
concerning events. But deep metaphysical problems will remain as to the nature
of these encities, their mode of individuation, their relarions to ocher categories.

Perhaps we will find a way of reducing events to entities of other kinds, for
example, sets of points in space-time, or ordered a-tuples of times, physical
objects, and classes of ordered a-tuples of such. Successful reductions along these
lines may, in an honoured tradition, be advertised as showing that there are no

such things as events. As long as the quantifiers and variables remain in the same
places, however, the analysis oflogical form will stick.

shown (by a sernanrical theory] to be valid without also proving the following
to be true; 'The striking of the tude old than by Oedipus was identical with the
striking of Oedipus's father by Oedipus'? Yet one of these actions was intentional

wanted inferences while not endorsing the identity; but we don't now have such
a theory.

I. &ply to Hedman. If we are committed to events, we are committed to making
sense ofidenriry-senrences, like 'a = b', where the terms flanking the identity sign
refer ro events. I think in fact we use sentences in this form constantly: 'The third
round of the fight was (identical with) the one in which he took a dive'. 'Our
worst accident was (identical with) the one where we hit four other cars', 'Falling
off the tower was (identical with) the cause of his death'. The problem of

individuation for events is the problem of giving criteria saying when such
sentences arc true. Carl Hedman raises a tricky question about these criteria as
applied co actions.

In Essay 2 above, I asserted, as Hedman says, that 'intentional actions are not a
class of actions'. I said this to protect my theory against an obvious objection. If
'intentional' modifies actions the way 'in the kitchen' does, then intentional
actions are a class of actions. Does Oedipus's striking of the rude old than belong
in this class or not? Oedipus struck the rude old than intentionally, but he did not
strike his father intentionally. But on my theory, these srrikings were one, since
the tude old than was Oedipus's father. The obvious solution, which I endorsed,
is to take 'intentionally' as crearing a semantically opaque context in which one
would expect substirutiviry of identity to seem to fail.

I did not argue for this view in the article Hedman discusses; in the long
passage he quotes I say only that it is 'the natural and, I think, correct answer'. In
that passage I was surveying a number of topics, such as causaliry, theory of
action, explanations, and the identity theory of mind, where philosophers tend to
say things which rake for granted an ontology of events and actions. My point
was that if they do make this assumption, they ought to come up with a serious
theory about how reference to events occurs; my intention was to soften up
potential opposition to the analysis which (I argued) is forced on us anyway when
we try to give a systematic semantics for natural language.

Elsewhere I have argued for the view that one and the same action may be
correccly said to be intentional (when described in one way) and not intentional
(when described in anomer). The position is hardly new with the; it was
expounded at length by Anscombc.w and has been accepted by many other
writers on action. It is harder 1O avoid taking this position than one might think.

I suppose no one wants 1O deny that if the rude old than was Oedipus's father,
then 'Oedipus struck the rude old than' and 'Oedipus struck his father' entail one
another. If one accepts. as Hedman apparently does, an ontology of evenrs, one
will also presumably want to infer 'The striking of the rude old than by Oedipus
occurred at the crossroads' from 'The striking of Oedipus's father by Oedipus
occurred at the crossroads' and vice versa. But how can these entailments be
