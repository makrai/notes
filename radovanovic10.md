Hubs in Space: Popular Nearest Neighbors in High-Dimensional Data
2010

#1. Introduction

* The curse of dimensionality, a 
  * term originally introduced by Bellman (1961),
  * the phenomena of distance concentration and hubness are related, but
    distinct.

#2. Related Work

* reverse nearest-neighbor search (Singh et al., 2003),
  * retrieve data points that have the query point q as one of their k NNs
  * Tao et al., 2007).
* in ε-neighborhood graphs, that is, graphs where two points are connected if
  the distance between them is less than a given limit ε, the hubness
  phenomenon does not occur.
* Concentration of cosine similarity was explored by Nanopoulos et al.  (2009).
