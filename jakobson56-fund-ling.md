# PART II TWO ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND TWO TYPES OF APHASIC DISTURBANCES


## Aphasia as a Linguistic Problem p55

## The Twofold Character of Language p58

* selection of certain linguistic entities and combination
* Saussure states that combination "is in presentia: it is based on two or
  several terms jointly present in an actual series," whereas [selection]
  "connects terms in absentia as members of a virtual mnemonic series".
* relation
  * constituents of a context are in a status of contiguity, while 
  * in a substitution set signs are linked by various degrees of similarity
    which fluctuate between the equivalence of synonyms and the common core of
    antonyms.

## Similarity Disorder p63

* first type (selection deficiency): When presented with scraps of words or
  sentences, such a patient readily completes them. His speech is merely
  reactive: he easily carries on conversa- tion, but has diflftculties in
  starting a dialogue;
  * hard for him to perform, or even to understand, such a closed discourse as
    the monologue.

## Contiguity Disorder p71

## V The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles p76
