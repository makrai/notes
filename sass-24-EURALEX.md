* Our proposed solution can be compared to the following approaches:
  * to present a browsable list of cxns to the user;
  * to work out a sophisticated query interface
    which reflects the subtleties of the cxn-representation;
  * to give the user a formal query language
    which works on the cxn-representation.
* Ccns tend to use the first two approaches
  * (cf. the Swedish ccn (Lyngfelt+ 2018b) and the Russian ccn (Janda+ 2020))
  * All these three are not ideal in our opinion.
    * The first approach is too limiting,
    * the other two expect some knowledge of the cxn-representation
      which we would like to hide from the user as we argued above.
