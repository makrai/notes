Adapting VerbNet to French using existing resources
LREC 2014

# Abstract

* [we use] two French resources: a semantic lexicon (Les Verbes Français) and
  a syntactic lexicon (Lexique-Grammaire)

# 1 Intro

* we first have translated top-level VerbNet members in French and used French
  linguistic resources that encode the syntactic and semantic behavior of
  verbs (Section 3.) to keep only the right translations (Section 4.1.). The
  second step in building Verb3net, which is still underway, is to adapt
  VerbNet syntactic alternations for French, which gives rise to various
  problems that we will discuss in Section 4.2.

# 2 Related work

* other languages, Merlo+ (2002) have used cross-linguistic similarities
  to convert 20 Levin classes to Italian
  * Automatic acquisitions have also been led in Japanese (Suzuki and Fukumoto
    2009), German (im Walde 2006), and Spanish (Ferrer 2004)
  * direct translations we are aware of are the Estonian VerbNet (Jentson 2014)
    and the Brazilian Portuguese VerbNet (Scarton and Aluısio 2012), which uses
    the mappings between VerbNet and WordNet(.Br)
* Our translation will be [open and] linked to the English VerbNet and the two

# 3 Presentation of VerbNet and French Lexical resources

* thematic roles nor semantic formulae [are] why we want to build ... Verb3net

# 4 Building Verb3net

* top hierarchy in Verb3net should be as close as possible to that in VerbNet
  *  verbs that are zero-related to nominals doesn’t have a French equivalent,

## Second step

* For example, all the frames involving a conative, dative or benefactive
  alternation can be systematically suppressed because these alternations don’t
  exist in French
* we decided for the time being to remove sub-frames
* order of the complements
  * VerbNet sometimes encodes two frames which differ only by the order
  * In French, the order of complements depends on a number of syntactic and
    semantic factors (Thuilier 2012), but [no] lexical factors

### 4.2.3. Case by case work

* semantic differences which are taken into account in VerbNet but not in
  LVF or in LG. For example, among the verbs of Sending and Carrying
  VerbNet distinguishes whether the Agt is in motion, French resources do not
* translation problems [with] motion verbs as illustrated in
  _John swam across the river_ → _Jean a traversé la rivière à la nage_
  (lit.  _John crossed the river with the swim_). We put aside those well-known
  * more subtle difficulties ... with the verbs of change of possession. In
    VerbNet, there exist ten classes dedicated to these verbs.  It seems that
    such a hi- erarchy cannot be adopted for French.  Without going into all
    the details, let us underline the following points:

# 5 Conclustion

* not yet completed. When it will be completed, we will make it freely
* part of the ASFALDA 6 project
  * goals include the creation of a French FrameNet and mappings
