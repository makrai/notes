#Abstract

* The present study attempts to measure and compare the morphological
  productivity of five Mandarin Chinese suffixes:
  the verbal suffix -hua, the plural suffix -men, and nominal suffixes
* These suffixes are predicted to differ in their degree of productivity: -hua
* Baayen [1989, 1992] proposes [measuring productivity] based on word-token frq
* [we propose] a type-based measure of productivity that
  * employs the deleted estimation method [Jelinek & Mercer, 1985] in defining
  * expresses productivity by the ratio of unseen word types to all word types
