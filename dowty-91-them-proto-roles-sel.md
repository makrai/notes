Thematic Proto-Roles and Argument Selection
Language, Vol. 67, No. 3, (Sep., 1991), pp. 547-619

* argument selection:
  * principles determining which roles are associated with which grammatical
    relations

# 1 Introduction

* thematic roles is so taken for granted that
  * psycholinguists
    * attempt to study their role in mental processing experimentally
    * (Carlson & Tanenhaus 1988, Stowe 1989); and
  * in formal semantics
    * an introductory text (Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet 1990) offers a
      technique for formalizing roles
* New candidates for thematic roles are being proposed all the time,
  * eg FIGURE and GROUND in Talmy 1985a,
* Deep Cases also served an argument-indexing function
  * [in early Case Grammar theory (Fillmore 1968)]
  * syntactic transformations are stated in terms of these labels
* individual thematic roles:
  * terms from Dowty 1989.5 That is,
  * we [call] the subject of the verb hit the 'hitter role',
* hierarchy of thematic roles
  * as Nishigauchi 1984 does in stating control principles
* 1:1? Jackendoff
  * some verbs assign more than one role to the same argument,
  * others assign the same role to two different arguments, and
  * some verbs 'have' thematic roles that they do not assign to any NP;
    for instance, to butter has both a Theme and a Goal role, but the Theme is
    'completely expressed by the verb'
* goals [of this paper] are more modest:
  1. to
    * lay some methodological groundwork for studying thematic roles
      with the tools of _model-theoretic semantics_, and to
     * propose some new strategies for attacking the area one step at a time;
  * (3) make syntacticians ...  recognize the dangers of continuing to take
    this notion for granted and of assuming that thematic roles are as well
    motivated as phonemes or phrase-markers
  * point out what psycholinguistic implications: some speculations
* sections
  2. the LOGICAL TYPE thematic roles should have, p7
    * summarizing briefly the results of Dowty 1989
  3. traditional empirical difficulties
  * what KIND of linguistic evidence ... for identifying a role type correctly
    4. ARGUMENT SELECTION
    5. that EVENT-DEPENDENT but not PERSPECTIVE-DEPENDENT roles
  6. a new kind of role, INCREMENTAL THEME
  7. a new theory of roles in which roles are 'prototypes'
    * THEMATIC PROTO-ROLES rather, than discrete categories (sec 7)
  8. argument-selection principles for this theory and their workings
    * three cases of subtly-contrasting argument selection:
      * partially symmetric interactive predicates (sec 9.1),
      * psychological predicates (sec 9.2), and the
      * spray/load alternations (sec 9.3)
  10. Comparisons ... with related proposals in the literature
  11. psycholinguistic implications suggested by this account for
    the place of thematic roles in the _acquisition_ of grammar and [lex]
  12. 'unaccusative' phenomenon
  13. summary

# 2 THE LOGICAL TYPE OF THEMATIC ROLES

* thematic role (type) is a set of entailments of a group of predicates
  * with respect to one of the arguments of each
  * Some of these entailments are also presuppositions
    * which ... correspond to the selectional restrictions of Chomsky 1965, but
    * semantic properties, not syntactic
* allow[ed] to be as precise as possible
  * in describing the substantive semantic CONTENT of thematic roles

# 3 Traditional problems in identifying thematic roles
  and using them to distinguish arguments P8

3.1. Role fragmentations and unclear boundaries
  * a little-studied thematic role that has been called EXTENT (Andrews 1985)
3.2. Cases [without] motivatable role that can distinguish two arguments
  * x resembles y
    * That there might [be] a difference in 'perspective'
    * I will address in sec 5 below
3.3.  Pitfalls of misidentifying the motivation for a role
  * the generalization in question is
  * 3.3.1. purely syntactic
  * 3.3.2. semantic
  * 3.3.3. pragmatic
  * 3.3.4. a consequence of
    general constraints between syntax and discourse structure

# 4 A proposed strategy for research on the semantics of thematic roles p14

# 10 Related proposals p53

* Jackendoff (76, 87) thematic roles are are defined in terms of configurations
  of semantic representation, DO, CAUSE, STAY
  * Dowty: aspect cannot be decomposed in such a way
  * do entailments correspond to configurations of structures with CAUSE, STAY
* Rozwadowska (1988) and Zaenek (1988)
  * describtions of role types in terms of semantic features
* Foley & Van Valin (1984)
  * two macro-roles, Actor and Undergoer
  * discrete categories
* Talmy (1985) Culicover & Wilkins (1986)
  * ACTION TIER (Agent, Patient)
  * MOTION TIER (Theme, Source, Goal)
  * Jackendoff add TEMPORAL TIER (aspect, time adv)
  * orthogonal to classes hier
* Keenan: Subject (1976) and Absolutive (1984)
* Lakoff (1977) and Hopper & Thompson (1980): continuous
  * Lakoff: Patienthood is the complement or absence of Agentivity
* Fillmore's later work on case (1977): hierarchy
  * saliency; humanness; change of state of location; definiteness and totality
