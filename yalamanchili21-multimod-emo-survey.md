# Abstract

* Voice recognition, Tracking implicit parameters, Facial expression
  recognition, Gesture recognition, Vital signals, and Hybrid methods
* Physiological features such as respiratory volume, skin temperature, heart
  rate, respiration pattern, EDA, PPG, and EMG
* fusion techniques which can be used are feature-level, hybrid multimodal,
  decision-level, rule-based, classification-based, model-level, and
  estimation-based fusions
* databases accumulated by researchers for these systems 
  * only text, only audio, only image, only video, audio and video,
    physiological data or audio, text, and video data
