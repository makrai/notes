## 2.1 formulations of the lexical entailment task and corresponding datasets,
with special emphasis on the two datasets used in our work

## 2.2 recent approaches to entailment and inference tasks

## 2.3 common approaches to semantic parsing

## 2.4 approaches to modeling entailment with semantic graphs

# 3 our pipeline

* building 4lang semantic graphs from Wiktionary entries and for
* obtaining additional synonyms both from Wiktionary and WordNet. The section
* using graph grammars to transform dependency trees to 4lang graphs, and
* our method for establishing entailment over pairs of 4lang graphs

# 4 evaluates our method on two recent benchmarks 14

* compares their performance to previous systems
* simple strategies for combining them with the output of SOTA NLI systems

# 5 results of manual error analysis on both datasets

# 6. Conclusion 19

* providing insight about the differences between the two formulations of the
  entailment task and identifying current shortcomings of our approach, along
  with possible solutions
* SherLIiC inspires us to think more deeply about synonymy, polysemy, dis-
  ambiguation, definitional economy, prepositional linkers, modal
  subordination, causativization, and a host of other questions that are
  traditionally considered central to natural language semantics
* WordNet, with its extensive hypernym links, tailor-made for entailment detect
  * can be profitably combined with other resources, dictionaries in particul
  * hE, for other relationals, such as causation, possession, mereological
    implications, spatiotemporal reasoning, etc WordNet is less helpful there
    * we would need similar datasets that highlight these very real problems
* future work, we hope to address several of the issues exemplified in our
  * a more explicit disambiguation process
    before, or in parallel to, the modeling of lexical entailment
