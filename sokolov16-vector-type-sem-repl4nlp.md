A Vector Model for Type-Theoretical Semantics
1st Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP 2016

# 1 Introduction

* logical polysemy and co-predication, which
  * received formal treatment in the works of Pustejovsky (1995) and are
  * among the central problems of type-theoretical semantics
    (Cooper, 2005; Asher, 2011; Luo, 2012)
* red apple, red watermelon and red crystal (Lahav, 1989). In these examples a
  * apple is red when most of its surface is red, a watermelon is red inside, a
    crystal is red entirely. It is possible to characterize a watermelon as
  * heavy book and boring book a book is treated as either a physical object or
    an information content.
  * Both aspects [correspond to different sets of properties, which are taken
    into account by the predicates and reflect in] e.g. hypernym relations
    (Hanks, 1996)
* co-predication
  * more predicates make use of conflicting meaning aspects of an argument,
  * A lunch was delicious but took forever. (Pustejovsky 1995)
