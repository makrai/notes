* mental disorders could sometimes turn to suicidal ideation without treatment
* Early detection of mental disorders and suicidal ideation from social content
  * a potential way for effective social intervention
* pretrained contextualized language representations
  * domain-specific pretrained models and several downstream applications
* we: two pretrained language models for mental healthcare
  * MentalBERT and MentalRoBERTa, to benefit machine learning for the mental
  * we evaluate our trained domain-specific models and several variants of
    pretrained language models on several mental disorder detection benchmarks
  * language representations pretrained in the target domain improve the
    performance of mental health detection tasks
