Intrinsic Evaluation of Word Vectors Fails to Predict Extrinsic Performance

# Abstract

* We study the correlation between results on
  * ten word similarity benchmarks and tagger performance on
  * three standard sequence labeling tasks using
  * a variety of word vectors induced from an
    * unannotated corpus of 3.8 billion words, and demonstrate that
* most intrinsic evaluations are poor predictors of downstream performance
* this issue can be traced in part to a 
  failure to distinguish specific similarity from relatedness
* We make our evaluation tools openly available
