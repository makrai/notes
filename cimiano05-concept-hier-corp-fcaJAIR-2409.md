Valency patterns in Italian
2015

# Project description [from http://www.valpal.info/about/project]

* The Leipzig Valency Classes Project, 
  * funded by the DFG between 2009 and 2013,
  * large-scale cross-linguistic comparison of valency classes, which 
  * resulted in the online database „Valency Patterns Leipzig (ValPaL)“.
  * inspired by Levin (1993)
* two outcomes of the project: an 
  * edited volume (edited by Bernard Comrie & Andrej Malchukov) and the 
  * online database ValPaL, 
    * by Iren Hartmann, Martin Haspelmath, & Bradley Taylor). The edited
  * Both ... are based on a database questionnaire for a 
    * selected sample of 80 verbs. These verbs are conceived of as
* rigorous review, and ... the revised version differs substantially 

# 1 Introduction

* organized as follows. 
  2. illustrates the general characteristics of Italian morphosyntax. 
  3. describes the major valency patterns of Italian, explored in 
  4. argument encoding and with reference to 
  5. and 6. valency changing operations
  7. provides the conclusions.

## 2.1 General characteristics of Italian

* fusional language (making use of both prefixation and suffixation) char-
  * high degree of allomorphic variation, with 
  * morphs tending to encode several meanings simultaneously, and an 
  * ensuing difficulty in segmenting words (Iacobini 2006). The syntactic
  * verb agreement ... singles out A/S vs P 2 (and R(ecipient) in three-arg vs)
  * marginally, word order, with A/S occurring preverbally and P postverbally
  * no cases, apart from 
    * a residual oblique forms for clitic ... for core 
    * (1/2/3 SG) tonic pronouns, used [for] non-core
  * typically, non-core arguments and adjuncts are coded through [prepositions]
  * SVO language [with] relative syntactic freedom and pragmatic rigidity, with
  * nominative-accusative language, with 
    * some domains where ... active-stative and even ergative 
  * dependent-marking ... at the clause and NP level, it shows 
  * head-marking ... in verbal syntax
    * pronominal arguments coded on the verb.
    * like other pro-drop languages, shows patterns of head marking, as
    * agreement for A, and the dative and accusative clitics for R and P, resp

## 2.2 Italian morphosyntax: Basic clause structure

* pro-drop language ... omitting subjects in topic and non-contrastive focus
* rich system of nominal and verbal agreement. 
  * Nouns, determiners, adjectives and past participles 
    * gender (masculine and feminine) ...  and number (singular and plural)
* active alignment, with 
  * intransitive verbs subdividing into 
    * unaccusatives/class S_P verbs ... “telic dynamic change” [of a Pat]
    * unergatives/class S_A verbs ... “atelic non-motional activity” [of an Ag]
  * reflecting their aspectual characteristics and the thematic role of the S
  * manifests itself through a number of syntactic features such as 
    * auxiliary selection – BE vs HAVE
    * ne-cliticisation of a quantified postverbal subject, as in (6a), where 
      * the clitic ne ‘of it’ replaces the subject nominal ragazzi ‘boys’, 
    * participial absolute constructions
    * adjectival function of the past participle (6c)
  * verb agreement is always with the A/S argument in simple tenses. 
  * In compound tenses ...  the past participle agreement depends on
    unaccusative vs unergativ

## 2.3 Argument coding

* Arguments in Italian are coded by means of 
  * verb agreement, – that singles out A/ S from P – and 
  * [prepositions], which occur with 
    * non-core arguments (e.g., recipient/ beneficiary phrases) and 
    * adjuncts (e.g., goal phrases). The adpositions (i.e.  prepositions)

## 2.4 Voice and valency rearranging ~ valency changing patterns and markers

* rich and very productive system of valency 
  * rearranging constructions, 
    * the oblique [to] subject alternation ... (§ 4.2) and 
      * original A argument unexpressed
    * the body-part possessor ascension (§ 4.3) are most widely used, unlike 
    * the conative (where the unattained P is marked [with a] preposition, 6.1
    * the locative (§ 6.2), and 
    * the applicative alternations (§ 6.3), which are marginal instead
  * changing patterns comprise 
    * object omission (§ 4.1), 
    * the factitive construction 
    (formed with the verbs fare ‘do/make’, lasciare ‘let’ + infinitive) (§ 5.1)
    * the reflexive/reciprocal/middle pattern, 
      marked by the reflexive morpheme _si_ (§ 5.2), 
    * anticausatives (§ 5.3), 
    * the reflexive passive (§ 5.4), 
    * impersonal reflexives, marking defocusing of A/S and P ... (§ 5.5), 
    * impersonal of (lexicalized) reflexives ... (§ 5.6), 
    * the analytic passive (§ 5.7)
      (formed with the auxiliaries essere ‘be’, venire ‘come’, andare ‘go’ + 
      the past participle of the lexical verb) 

# 3 Valency patterns

## 3.1 Identification of valency classes

* Two useful syntactic tests for differentiating non-core arguments from adjs
  * preposing/free permutation, that is only possible with adjuncts
  * variation in the number and type of adposition(s), possible with adjuncts,

## 3.2 Avalent verbs (coding frame: ((S) > V.subj[3SG/S])

* metereological phenomena ...  and astronomical events

## 3.3 Monovalent verbs (coding frame: `<S>V.subj[S]`)

* stative verbs (giacere ‘lie’, scarseggiare ‘be short of’, vivere ‘live’)
* continuation of states (sopravvivere ‘survive’)
* uncontrolled process (activity) (attecchire ‘catch on’, squillare ‘ring’)
* indefinite change ... no endpoint (e.g, marcire ‘rot’, arrossire ‘blush’)
* manner of motion verbs 
  (volare ‘fly’, atterrare ‘land’, saltare ‘jump’, correre ‘run’) (21d):

## 3.4 Bivalent verbs (coding frame: `A > V.subj [A] (con+I`)

* subclasses, varying both in their 
  * aspectual characteristics and in the 
    * achievements (e.g., spezzare ‘crack’)
    * different types of accomplishments
    * activities (e.g., colpire ‘hit’, lavare ‘wash’) and 
    * states (e.g., amare ‘love’, vedere ‘see’) 
  * inherent (e.g., animacy) and relational properties of the A and P arguments
    (e.g., control and affectedness). They comprise 
* three syntactic tests in Italian: 
  passivization, anticausativization and optionality of the object.
* three subtypes of experiencer verbs, so-called psychverbs 
  (Belletti & Rizzi 1988; Arad 1998; Bentley 2006: 93–120)
  Class 
  * ‘fear’-verbs (amare ‘love’, ammirare ‘admire’, disprezzare ‘despise’,
    ricordare ‘remember’, conoscere ‘know’, etc)
  * ‘frighten’-verbs
  * ‘like’-verbs (so-called inversion verbs (Bossong 1998)), includes verbs
  * non-correspondence between the semantic role ... and the syntactic confs
  * interplay of the 
    * aspectual nature of the verb (e.g., the presence/absence of a change)
    * agentivity/control of the subject/object

## 3.5 Trivalent verbs (coding frame: `A > V.subj[A] > T (a+R) (L) (I) (di+X)`)

* three nuclear arguments, 
  * A, the agent, surfacing as subject,
  * P, the theme object, and the 
  * goal/beneficiary of the eventuality described by the verb, 
    * realized either by 
      * animate/animate-like NPs ... encoded [with] preposition a ‘to’, di
      * a locative phrase
* subtypes of trivalent verbs (and related coding frames) can be identified,
  * physical transfer (e.g., dare ‘give’, inviare ‘send’, vendere ‘sell’,...)
    prestare ‘lend’, comprare ‘buy’, restituire ‘return’), as in (36a),
  * mental transfer (e.g., mostrare ‘show’, dire ‘tell’, spiegare ‘explain’...)

# 4 Uncoded argument alternations

* a very pervasive pattern of P deletion [and] argument rearranging strategies,
  * degrees of productivity, reflecting the aspectual characteristics of verbs
    and the inherent and relational properties of core and non-core arguments.
* instances
  * The most productive uncoded alternations are object omission (§ 4.1), the
    * aspectual characteristics of verbs interact [with lexical meaning] 
      e.g., the type of result encoded, animacy, definiteness, referentiality
  * oblique [to] subject alternation (§ 4.2) and the 
  * body-part possessor ascension alternation (§ 4.3). 
  * Other, less productive alternations are discussed in § 6.
* oblique [to] subject alternation (§ 4.2) and the 
  * occurs with verbs of different aspectual classes (achievements,
    accomplishments, activities) and comprises 
  * four main subtypes: 
    * the Time subject alternation, occurring with verbs such as vedere ‘see’
    * the Instrument subject alternation, including 
      * natural forces (47b), 
      * instantiated by verbs like seccare, asciugare ‘dry’, riscaldare ‘heat’,
        variare ‘vary’, riprodurre ‘reproduce’, and 
      * intermediary instruments e.g. _rompere_ ‘break’, caricare ‘load’
    * the Instrument subject alternation with object omission, a pattern
      confined to modal or negative polarity contexts
    * the Locatum subject alternation
