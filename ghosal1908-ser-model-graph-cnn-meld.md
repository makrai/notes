# Abstract

* Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has received much attention,
  * applications in health-care, education, and human resources. In this
  * we present Dialogue Graph Convolutional Network (DialogueGCN),
    * a graph neural network based approach to ERC
    * We leverage self and inter-speaker dependency of the interlocutors to
      model conversational context for emotion recognition
    * Through the graph network, DialogueGCN addresses context propagation
      issues present in the current RNN-based methods. We empirically show that
* outperforming the current SOTA on a number of emotion classif benchmarks
