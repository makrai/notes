# Abstract

* Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues (“goluboy”) and
  darker blues (“siniy”)
* We investigated whether this leads to differences in color discrimination We
* English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using
* Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into
  different linguistic categories in Russian than when they were from the same
* advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task. These
  effects were stronger for difficult discriminations than for easy
* English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did not show a category
  advantage in any of the conditions
* ie the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interfer)
