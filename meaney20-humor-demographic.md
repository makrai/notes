ACL 2020 Student Research Workshop

# Abstract

* Recent humor classification shared tasks have struggled with two issues:
  * highly constrained genre of humor which does or 
  * the data is so indiscriminate that
    the inter-annotator agreement on its humor content is drastically low
* typically average over all annotators’ judgments,
  in spite of the fact that humor is a highly subjective phenomenon
* We argue that demographic factors influence whether a text is humorous
  * propose the addition of 
    * demographic information about the humor annotators in order to bin
    * an ‘offensive’ label to distinguish between different generations
* could lead to better performance on eg content moderation
