# Abstract

* Zipf’s meaning-frequency law
  * words that are more frequent tend to have more meanings
* Here it is shown that a linear dependency between the frequency of a form and
  its number of meanings is found in a family of models of Zipf’s law for word
  frequencies.  This is evidence for a weak version of the meaning-frequency
  law.  Interestingly, that weak law (a) is not an inevitable of property of
  the assumptions of the family and (b) is found at least in the narrow regime
  where those models exhibit Zipf’s law for word frequencies

    Testing the robustness of laws of polysemy and brevity versus frequency
* In his pioneering research, Zipf defined two laws (Zipf 1945; Zipf 1949)
  * \mu, the number of meaning of a word
  * [as a function of word rank `i`] Eq 1.
    `\mu \propto i^{-\gamma}`
    * Zipf (1949) referred to [Eq 1] as the law of meaning distribution
    * in his most famous book
  * [as a function of word frequency `i`] Eq 2.
    `\mu \propto f^{-\delta}`
    * [Zipf] referred to [Eq 2] as the meaning-frequency relationship
    * in a less popular article (Zipf, 1945)
    * The target of the preset article
* support ...  independently from Zipf’s law for word frequencies
  * After Zipf’s untimely  decease [korai halála]
  * for Eq 2 (Baayen & Moscoso del Prado Martín 2005; Crossley et al. 2010;
    Hernández-Fernández et al. 2016)
   * for Eq 1 (Ilgen & Karaoglan 2007)
* weak version of the meaning-frequency law can be defined 
  * simply as a positive correlation between \mu and f
  * not assuming a Pearson correlation here, which is ... linear (Conover 1999)
  * non-linear ..., e.g., Spearman rank correlation (Conover 1999; Zhou+ 2003)
  * justified for various reasons
    * pure power law ... can be deceiving. This is a lesson of research on
      * Menzerath-Altmann law in genomes (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al.  2013a),
      * Heaps’ law in texts (Font-Clos & Corral 2015) or the
      * degree distribution of protein interaction and metabolic networks
        (Stumpf & Ingram 2005; Stumpf et al.  2005)
  * [no] mathematical argument illuminating the origins of [Zipf's] laws

  * unified approach to human language and [animal communication]
    * positive correlation between frequency and behavioral context (a proxy
      for meaning) ... in dolphin whistles (Ferrer-i-Cancho & McCowan 2009)
* Here we investigate ... a family of Zipfian optimization models
  (Ferrer-i-Cancho & Solé 2003; Ferrer-i-Cancho 2005)
  * yield Eq.  2 with \delta = 1 thus 
    satisfying only the weak meaning-frequency relationship

# 4. A weak meaning-frequency law is possible

# 5. Discussion

* [gyanús a cikk, mindenesetre ezt állítja:]
  * but as far as we know the family of models reviewed here is the only that
  illuminates the origin of
    * the principle of contrast and also
    * the tendency of children to attach new words to unlinked meanings
      (Ferrer-i-Cancho 2013)
* It is tempting to conclude that the prediction of a linear relationship
  between number of meanings and frequency ... is a reason to abandon this kind
  of models (i.e. the current family or variants stemming from it).  Although
* predictions of current models of Zipf’s law beyond word frequencies are
  unknown, unexplored or simply impossible (Piantadosi 2014).  There is at
