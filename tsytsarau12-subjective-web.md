Survey on mining subjective data on the web
Data Min Knowl Disc (2012)

# Abstract

* In the past years Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining in
  Information Retrieval and Web data analysis
  * Ratings, opinion trends and representative opinions enrich the search
  * Opinion aggregation over product reviews
  * how opinions or discussions evolve over time
  * the ways that information is propagated in the Internet
* In this study, we review the development of Sentiment Analysis and Opinion M
  + Contradiction Analysis

# Intro

* subjectivity filtering is applied (Riloff+ 2005)
  * analyzing sentiments expressed by the authors, or
  * discovering explicit marks of contradiction with other texts
    (Ennals+ 2010b)
* our attention [is whether the subjective data] on the web [is] useful
* opinions aggregated at a large scale may reflect political preferences
  (Tumasjan+ 2010) and even improve stock market prediction
* we will use the term Subjectivity Analysis to refer to all three of
  Opinion Mining and Opinion Aggregation + Contradiction Analysis

## 1.1 Relation to previous work

* [our] classification of the papers into four different approaches
  * machine learning, dictionary-based, statistical, and semantic. We provide
* topics that have emerged only recently:
  * opinion mining in microblogs and streaming data 6 studies
  * opinion quality and spam, where we present 5 techniques that try to
    * detect artificially-constructed opinionated data
  * and contradiction analysis, where we report on 17 approaches

# 2 2 Subjectivity analysis: a general view

* confluence of different approaches
  * Opinion Mining originates from the IR community
  * Sentiment Analysis was initially formulated as [an] NLP task

# 3 Opinion mining 5

## 3.2 Problems in opinion mining 6

* two steps:
  * identify (topics, opinionative sentences), and
  * classify (sentences, documents)
    * distinguish between opinionative and non-opinionative _phrases_
      (Wiebe+ 2001; Dave+ 2003; Pang and Lee 2004; Riloff+
      2005; Wiebe and Riloff 2005; Wilson+ 2005). Furthermore,
    * retrieval of opinionative documents evolved into a separate task
