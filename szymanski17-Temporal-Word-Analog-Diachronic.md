# Abstract

* we introduce temporal word analogies
  * pairs of words which occupy the same semantic space
    at different points in time
  * “word w1 at time t𝛼 is like word w2 at time t𝛽”) can effectively be modeled
    with diachronic word embeddings, provided that
    the independent embedding spaces from each time period are appropriately
    transformed into a common vector space
* applied to a diachronic corpus of news articles, this method is able to
  * “Ronald Reagan in 1987 is like Bill Clinton in 1997”, or
  * “Walkman in 1987 is like iPod in 2007”
