# Abstract

* Analysis of behavior in depression primarily relies on subjective measures
* auto audiovisual measurement of behaviors that humans struggle to quantify
  (eg movement velocity & voice inflection)
  * potential to improve screening and diagnosis, identify new behavioral
    indicators of depression, measure response to clinical intervention, and
    test clinical theories about underlying mechanisms
* Highlights include a study that
  * measured the temporal coordination of vocal tract and facial movements, a
  * predicted which adolescents would go on to develop depression
    based on their voice qualities, and a study that
  * tested the behavioral predictions of clinical theories
    using automated measures of facial actions and head motion
