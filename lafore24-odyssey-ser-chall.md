# Abstract

* we take advantage of both audio signal information and semantic information
  obtained from automatic transcripts. We propose
* several models for each modality and three different fusion methods for the
  classification task.  The results show that
* adding semantic information improves significantly the performance and allows
* surpassing the challenge baseline, which is an audio only system, from a
  0.311 macro F1-score to 0.337
