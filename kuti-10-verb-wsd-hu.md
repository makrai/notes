2010 LREC

# 1 The challenge

* Véronis (2003) tried to show the
  * problematic nature of the intuition-based meaning-definition and the
  * inapplicability of enumerative lexicons in WSD through two experiments
  * first experiment ... showed that the inter-annotator agreement was [low]
    even regarding the question whether a certain word form was ... polysemous

# 2. The resources

* Hungarian Explanatory Dictionary (henceforward HED)
  * approx. 75000 entries, including collocations and idioms
  * main senses and their sub-senses
* Frequency Dictionary of Verb Phrase Constructions (Sass & Pajzs, 2009)
  * hibásan annotáltak, ld. sec~5 utolsó hasáb
* Hungarian WordNet (henceforward HuWN) (see Miháltz+ 2008)
  * developed between 2005 and 2007,

# 3. The case study

## 3.2. The data

* verbs are in general more polysemous than nouns and adjectives
  * Palmer, Dang and Fellbaum
    Making fine-grained and coarse-grained sense distinctions, both manually
    and automatically
    2007 Natural Language Engineering
  * Véronis' results for adjectives and nouns are [in] the same order of
    magnitude as the results for verbs,

# 5. Interpretation of the results

* it was the Hungarian verbal WordNet on the basis of which the best ITA-value
  was obtained, with the exception of the sense-cluster oriented evaluation of
  the Hungarian Explanatory Dictionary
* whereas the fine-grainedness of the sense distinctions highly influences the
  ITA-value (compare the two values obtained by two evaluation perspectives on
  the HED results), the polisemy of the verb alone does not. For example the
  verb köt (bind) is one of the most polysemous verbs among the selected ones,
  has one of the highest ITA-values on the basis of the HuWN, and the highest
  ITA-values on the basis of FDVC were obtained for verbs with above 15
  constructions as categories
