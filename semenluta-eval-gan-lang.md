# Abstract

* The latest works introducing novel GAN models for language generation use
  n-gram based metrics for evaluation and only report single scores of the best
  run
* In this paper, we
  * GAN models can be extremely sensitive to the random initialization and
    small deviations from the best hyperparameter choice. In particular, we
  * previously used BLEU score is not sensitive to semantic deterioration of
  * [we] propose alternative metrics that better capture the quality and
    diversity of the generated samples. We also conduct a set of
* experiments comparing a number of GAN models for text with a conventional
  Language Model (LM) and find that
  * neither of the considered models performs convincingly better than the LM
