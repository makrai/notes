# Abstract

* how ... the choice of words and sentence structure [can affect achieve
  widespread public awareness]
* we develop an analysis framework and
  * build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in
  * find that memorable quotes use
    * less common word choices, but at the same time are
    * built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns . Another is that
      * make them easy to apply in new contexts — that is, more portable.  We
    * the concept of “memorable language” can be extended across domains.

* containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text.
  * In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners
