Polysemy: Theoretical and Computational Approaches
2000

Reviewed by Jean Véronis Université de Provence, Aix-en-Provence

# Chapter 1 the main theories of meaning and their treatment of polysemy

* theories
  * the classical Aristotelian approach revived by Katz and Fodor (1963),
  * Rosch’s (1977) prototypical approach which
    * has its roots in Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (1953)
* relational approach recently exemplified by WordNet (Fellbaum 1998)
  * can be traced back to Peirce’s (1931–1958) and Selz’s (1913, 1922) graphs
  * gained popularity with Quillian’s (1968) semantic networks
* In the course of this overview, Ravin and Leacock put the individual chapters
  into perspective by relating them to the various theories

# In Chapter 2, “Aspects of the micro-structure of word meanings”, D. Alan Cruse

* addresses the issue of the extreme context-sensitivity of word meaning

# Chapter 3 by Christiane Fellbaum is devoted to “autotroponymy”

* This term requires a two-step explanation
* Troponyms are
  verb hyponyms, that refer to specific manners of performing other verbs
  eg _stammer, babble, whisper_, and _shout_, are troponyms of _talk_
* Autotroponymy verbs linked by this relation share the same form
  eg The children behaved / The children behaved well
