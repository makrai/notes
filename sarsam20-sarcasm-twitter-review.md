# Abstract

* Recognizing both literal and figurative meanings is crucial to understanding
  opinions on various topics or events in social media
  * sarcastic tweets often include
    positive words that represent negative or undesirable characteristics
    * The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
      (PRISMA) statement was used to understand the application of different
      machine learning algorithms for sarcasm detection in Twitter
* 31 studies classified into two groups:
  * Adapted Machine Learning Algorithms (AMLA)
  * Customized Machine Learning Algorithms (CMLA)
* revealed
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the best and the most commonly used AMLA
    for sarcasm detection in Twitter
  * combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and SVM was found to offer a
    high prediction accuracy
  * using lexical, pragmatic, frequency, and part-of-speech tagging can
    contribute to the performance of SVM
  * both lexical and personal features can enhance the performance of CNN-SVM
