# Abstract

* Recognizing both literal and figurative meanings is crucial to understanding
  usersâ€™ opinions on various topics or events in social media. Detecting the
  sarcastic posts on social media has received much attention recently,
  * sarcastic comments in the form of tweets often include positive words that
    represent negative or undesirable characteristics. The Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used
    to understand the application of different machine learning algorithms for
    sarcasm detection in Twitter. Extensive database searching led to the
    inclusion of
* 31 studies classified into two groups:
  * Adapted Machine Learning Algorithms (AMLA) and
  * Customized Machine Learning Algorithms (CMLA).  The review results
* revealed that
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the best and the most commonly used AMLA
    for sarcasm detection in Twitter. In addition,
  * combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and SVM was found to offer a
    high prediction accuracy.  Moreover, our result showed that
  * using lexical, pragmatic, frequency, and part-of-speech tagging can
    contribute to the performance of SVM, whereas
  * both lexical and personal features can enhance the performance of CNN-SVM.
