# Abstract

* Shift work: working outside of normal circadian cycles
  ~> experience of both fatigue and poorer long-term physical and mental health
  * current methods for assessing fatigue present several barriers to
    understanding how these risks develop over time within individuals
* we: momentary speech activity-based fatigue measurement
  in a large, multi-lingual cohort of shift workers, using an
  * intensive longitudinal study design (twice-daily measurement over two weeks
    in N=1,197 individuals from six countries)
* Paralinguistic speech features were used to
  predict different aspects of acute and chronic fatigue at each time-point,
  * performance assessed in unseen (held-out) data
  * both across the dataset as a whole, and for user-specific prediction models
* Findings
  * cross-sectional analysis, good (close to or exceeding current SOTA) perf
    for both current sleep deprivation and self-reported sleepiness levels
  * within-user analysis revealed robust increases in performance
    * more subjective aspects of fatigue detected 
    * eg pervasive physical and mental exhaustion
  * ie brief momentary speech samples are a low-burden, acceptable, and
    reliable measure of different aspects of fatigue
    in high-risk populations such as shift workers
* Clinical Implications
  * Developing brief, accessible measures of different dimensions of fatigue is
    an important step towards understanding
    how risks for poorer health outcomes develop over time
    within individuals exposed to significant circadian disruption

# Methods

* time since last sleep or time since last shift

# Data availability

* Due to licensing and IP considerations, the supporting dataset is 
  * not generally publicly available. However, 
  * nL we are open to partnering with research institutes and individual
    academics, including data sharing
