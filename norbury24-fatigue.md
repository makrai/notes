# Abstract

* Background. Shift work, or working outside of normal circadian cycles, is
  ~> both experience of fatigue and poorer long-term physical and mental health
  * current methods for assessing fatigue present several barriers to building
    understanding of how these risks develop over time within individuals.
* Objective. Here, we explore the potential of
  momentary speech activity-based fatigue measurement
  in a large, multi-lingual cohort of shift workers, using an
  intensive longitudinal study design (twice-daily measurement over two weeks
  in N=1,197 individuals from six different countries).
* Methods. Paralinguistic speech features were used to predict different
  aspects of acute and chronic fatigue at each study time-point, with
  performance assessed in unseen (held-out) data. Results are reported 
  * both across the dataset as a whole, and for user-specific prediction models
* Findings. In the 
  * cross-sectional analysis, good (close to or exceeding current SOTA) perf
    for both current sleep deprivation and self-reported sleepiness levels. The 
  * within-user analysis revealed robust increases in performance, yielding the
    ability to detect more subjective aspects of fatigue 
    eg pervasive physical and mental exhaustion.
* Conclusions. These findings offer preliminary support for the utility of
  using brief momentary speech samples as a low-burden, acceptable, and
  reliable measure of different aspects of fatigue in high-risk populations
  such as shift workers.
* Clinical Implications
  * Developing brief, accessible measures of different dimensions of fatigue is
    an important step towards understanding
    how risks for poorer health outcomes develop over time
    within individuals exposed to significant circadian disruption
