# Abstract

* FinCasual shared task for modeling causality in financial utterances. Our
* we fine-tuning a transformer-based language model with a twist, i.e. we
  modified the training and inference mechanism such that our model produces
  multiple predictions for the same instance. By designing such a model that
  * more resource efficient training (as opposed to fine-tuning some
    pre-trained language model k independent times), but our results indicate
  * capable of obtaining comparable or even better evaluation scores that way
* We compare multiple strategies for combining the k predictions of our model
* Our submissions got ranked third on both subtasks of the shared task
