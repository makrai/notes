# Welcome to Lexical-Functional Grammar

## Introduction

* Joan Bresnan had become concerned about psycholinguistic evidence that seemed
  * something was wrong with the concept of transformations.

## “Lexical”

### Lexical Integrity Principle

structure above the level of the word (syntax)
and structure below the level of the word (morphology).

## “Functional”

* The first challenge to the c-structural approach to grammatical functions
  came from Paul Postal and David Perlmutter in a series of lectures at the
  Summer Institute of the Linguistic Society of America in 1974. These lectures
  developed into the theory of Relational Grammar (Perlmutter, ed 1983),
* Mi van a c-szerkezetben? Struturalista, minimalista...?
* The feature PRED is very important. The idea behind it is that the existence
  of meaningful items is relevant to the syntax. Of course, the meaning itself
  is not part of syntactic representation, but certain aspects of meaning are.
* oblique argument: an argument whose (thematic) role is identified
  morphologically
* _A kútra addig jár a korsó, amíg el nem törik_?

## Additional Readings

Mathematical properties of LFG grammars have been discussed in Kaplan and Bresnan
(1982) and many of the papers in Dalrymple, Kaplan, Maxwell, and Zaenen, eds. (1995).
