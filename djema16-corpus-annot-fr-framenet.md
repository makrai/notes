# Abstract

* ASFALDA project [phases]
  1. development of a French set of frames and corresponding lexicon
    (Candito et al., 2014)
  2. this paper concentrates on the subsequent
    * corpus annotation phase, which
    * focused on four notional domains (commercial transactions, cognitive
      stances, causality and verbal communication). Given
* full coverage is not reachable for a relatively “new” FrameNet project, we
* frames and roles were annotated on two French Treebanks
  * Abeillé and Barrier, (2004) and the
  * Sequoia Treebank (Candito and Seddah, 2012)
* In the resource’s current status, there are
  98 frames, 662 frame-evoking words, 872 senses, and about 13000 annotated
  frames, with their semantic roles assigned to portions of text
