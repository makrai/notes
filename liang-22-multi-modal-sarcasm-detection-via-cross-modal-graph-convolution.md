# Abstract

* increasing popularity of posting multimodal messages online
* we: multi-modal sarcasm detection by constructing
  a cross-modal graph for each instance to
  explicitly draw the ironic relations between textual and visual modalities.
  1. detect the objects paired with descriptions of the image modality, enabling
     the learning of important **visual** information.
  2. the descriptions of the objects are served as a bridge to determine the
     importance of the association between the objects of image modality and the
     contextual words of text modality, so as to build a cross-modal graph for
     each multi-modal instance. Furthermore, we devise 
  3. a cross-modal graph convolutional network to make sense of the incongruity
     relations between modalities for multi-modal sarcasm detection.  
* Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis
  * SOTA performance in multi-modal sarcasm detection
