# Abstract

* We
  * ground word embeddings in semantic spaces studied in the
    cognitive-psycho_metric_ literature, taking these spaces as the primary
    objects to recover
  * relate log co-occurrences of words ... to semantic similarity assessments
    * show that co-occurrences are indeed consistent with an Euclidean semantic
      space hypothesis
  * unifies existing word embedding algorithms,
    ties them to manifold learning, and
    ... given co-occurrence counts from random walks.  Furthermore, we
  * propose a simple, principled, direct metric recovery algorithm
    * performs on par with the state-ofthe-art word embedding and manifold
      learning methods.  Finally, we complement recent focus on analogies by
  * two new inductive reasoning datasets
    * series completion and classification
