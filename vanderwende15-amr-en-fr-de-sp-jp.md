* we demonstrate our online AMR parser that allows users to submit any sentence
  * generated by a small set of rules that convert a native Logical Form
    analysis provided by a preexisting parser (see Vanderwende, 2015) into
    the AMR format. While we demonstrate the performance of our AMR parser 
* eval on data sets annotated by the LDC, we will focus attention in the demo
* we will make available the AMR data sets that were used for development
  * to serve as a supplement to the LDC data sets
  * parsers for German, French, Spanish and Japanese that using small set of
    LF-to-AMR conversion rules
