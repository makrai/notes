# Abstract

* Humor depends upon many factors, including topic, date, and recipient
  => hard to determine what exactly makes a joke humorous (joke identification)
* current humor datasets are lacking in both joke variety and size (< 100k)
* we compile a collection of over 550,000 jokes posted over an 11 year period
  on the Reddit r/Jokes subreddit (an online forum), providing a large scale
  humor dataset that can easily be used for a myriad of tasks
  * quantitative metrics for the level of humor in each joke, as determined by
    subreddit user feedback
  * contains almost even percentages of negative and positive sentiment,
  * strong contrasts between non-humorous and humorous jokes
* We explore this dataset through the years, examining basic statistics, most
  mentioned entities, and sentiment proportions
* also as a task for future work: predict the level of humor in a joke
* we provide strong SOTA baseline models and show room for future improvement
* We hope that this dataset will help
  * computational humor
  * social scientists who seek to understand popular culture through humor

# 1 Intro

* Understanding humor in psychology, linguistics, and even health research
  (Wolff+, 1934; Norrick, 1993; Knapp+, 1992)
  * often fickle and difficult for even humans to understand
  * Computational research in the field of natural language processing
    * understanding (Hempelmann, 2008),
    * classifying (Zhang and Liu, 2014; Chen and Soo, 2018), and
      * Chen, P-Y and Soo, V-W
        Humor recognition using deep learning
        NAACL 2018 Volume 2 (Short Papers), Jun
    * generating (He+, 2019; Valitutti+, 2013) humorous text
    * understand the structures that create humor
      (LÃ³pez and Vaid, 2017; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005)
* SemEval competitions, which include
  * pun detection in English (Miller+, 2017) in 2017 and a
  * humorous headline regression task in 2020 (Hossain+, 2019)
* other recent tasks in humor identification
  (Yang+, 2015; Chen and Soo, 2018; Weller and Seppi, 2019)
* hE small datasets with between 10-100k instances, usually on specific area eg
  * puns (Yang+, 2015),
  * Ted Talks (Chen and Soo, 2018), or
  * TV shows (Purandare and Litman, 2006)
* generation, with recent models including GANs (Luo+, 2019), RNNs (Yu+, 2018),
  and retrieval models (He+, 2019)
  * GPT-2 (Radford+, 2019)'s success has not translated into humor generation
  * GPT-generated is preferred to actual jokes 7 % (Luo+, 2019)
  * retrieval based generative models generate puns 31% of the time (He+ 2019)
* lack of large corpora available for the training of these systems
  * large corpora were a contributing factor to the success of other sub-fields
    eg machine translation or language modeling
    * GigaWord, BooksCorpus, and the Common Crawl (Parker+, 2011; Zhu+, 2015)
* we: scraping, processing, and filtering the largest humor dataset to date,
  * 573,335 jokes in English
  * labels for the body and punchline of the jokes, the level of humor present,
    and the date of posting
  * analysis of basic features, yearly trends, and
  * strong baselines for a new humor prediction task
* this dataset will be used in pursuit of the following research areas
  * Understanding what creates humor: analyzing the structure and context
  * Examining reactions to public events, as measured through humor
  * as a resource for? different but related tasks, such as irony or satire
  * Generating humor using this corpus as a resource for large scale training
