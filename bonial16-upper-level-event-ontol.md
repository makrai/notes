Multimodal Use of an Upper-Level Event Ontology
2016 acl workshop

# Abstract

* lexical sense distinctions from VerbNet, FrameNet and the 
  Rich Entities, Relations and Events Project
* facilitates interoperability and the combination of annotations 
* here we take the initial steps in ... multimodal applications, 
  * specifically to recognize and reason about events in both text and video.

# Introduction & Background

* efforts to use both text and visual data jointly to interpret complex scenes
  (e.g., Karpathy et al., 2014). Furthermore, we have seen the promise of
* integrating ontological information into computer vision research 
  * ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), 
    a large-scale ontology of images built upon the structure of WordNet
