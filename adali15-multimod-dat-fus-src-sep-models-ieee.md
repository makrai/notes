#ABSTRACT 

* very little is known about the actual interaction among the data sets
	* minimize the underlying assumptions
	* data-driven methods, and in particular of 
* independent component analysis (ICA) as it provides useful 
	* decompositions with a simple generative model and using 
	* only the assumption of statistical independence
* independent vector analysis (IVA), 
	* recent[ly] generalizes ICA to multiple data sets 
		by exploiting the statistical dependence across the data sets
* In this paper ... two multivariate solutions for multimodal data fusion
	* joint ICA model that has found wide application in medical imaging, and the
	* the transposed IVA model introduced here as 
    a generalization of an approach based on multiset canonical correlation
    analysis
