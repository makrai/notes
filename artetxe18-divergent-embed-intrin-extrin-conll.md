# Abstract

* it has been argued that there is no such thing as an ideal word representation
  * different models tend to capture divergent and often mutually incompatible
    aspects like semantics/syntax and similarity/relatedness. In this paper,
* we show that each embedding model captures more information than directly appr
  * A linear transformation that adjusts the similarity order of the model
    without any external resource can tailor it to achieve
    better results in those aspects, providing a
    new perspective on how embeddings encode divergent linguistic information
  * explore the relation between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation, as
    * the effect of our transformations in downstream tasks is
      higher for unsupervised systems than for supervised ones
