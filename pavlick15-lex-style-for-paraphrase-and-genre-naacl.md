* more generalized characterizations of the lexicon (Brown et al., 1992;
  * Wilson et al., HLT+EMNLP 2005
    Recognizing contextual polarity in phrase-level sentiment analysis

    Gender and animacy knowledge discovery from web-scale n-grams
    for unsupervised person mention detection
  * Resnik, IJCAI 1995
    Using information content to evaluate semantic similarity in a taxonomy
  * for [NLP] systems (Miller et al., 2004; Rutherford and Xue, 2014;
    Velikovich et al., 2010; Dodge et al., 2012)
* larger units of text

    What makes writing great?  First experiments on article quality prediction
    in the science journalism domain
  * Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012
  * Greene and Resnik, 2009
  * Xu et al., 2012) and studies of style at
* lexical level, ... categorize genre in multiple continuous dimensions
  ... via graph propagation or crowdsourcing
  (Brooke et al., 2010; Brooke and Hirst, 2013b; Brooke and Hirst, 2013a)
* We propose a simple and flexible
  * method for placing phrases along a style spectrum. We focus on
    * two dimensions: formality and complexity. We
  * evaluate the resulting scores in terms of their
    * correlation with human judgements as well as their utility
    * in two tasks. First, we use the induced dimensions to
      * identify stylistic shifts in ... PPDB with high accuracy.  Second, we
      * scores capture differences between genres, and
  * explore the extent to which these
    differences are due to topic versus lexical choice between styl[es]
    * style alone does differentiate between genres, and that the
    * combined indicators of style and topic are highly effective in describing
      genre in a way consistent with human judgements
