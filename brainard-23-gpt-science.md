* DetectGPT unlike other detectors, doesn’t require training
  * examines text by creating multiple, random variations and
    querying a text generator to rank which versions it prefers
  * The extent to which the generator the team studied—developed by OpenAI and
    similar to ChatGPT—prefers the original text versus the altered versions is
    consistently different for human-written versus AIgenerated text, allowing
    DetectGPT to predict the likelihood that a sample came from a particular
    machine
  * hE needs more development before journal editors can exclusively rely on
    its results to make decisions on manuscripts, for example, says Eric
    Williams, a doctoral student who led the Stanford team
* The company TurnItIn, which markets a widely used plagiarism detector, said
  last week it plans to roll out a synthetic text detector as early as April.
  TurnItIn says the tool, trained on academic writing, can identify 97% of text
  generated by ChatGPT, with a false positive rate of one in 100.
