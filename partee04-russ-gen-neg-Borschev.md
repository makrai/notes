The Semantics of Russian Genitive of Negation:
  The Nature and Role of Perspectival Structure
Barbara H. Partee & Vladimir Borschev

# 0. Introduction

* In many languages, existential sentences have a special syntactic shape,
  * different from regular subject-predicate sentences
  * But in Russian, with its “freedom” of word order and lack of articles, the
    difference is less obvious in many cases
(1) a. V gorode byl doktor
       In town was-M.SG doctor-NOM.M.SG
       'There was a doctor in town.'
    b. Doktor byl v gorode
        doctor-NOM.M.SG was-M.SG in town
        'The doctor was in town.'
  * differ only in Theme-Rheme structure and word order (and correspondingly in
    definiteness of the bare NP)
* hE under negation, the well-known “Genitive of Negation” (GenNeg) distinguish
  (2) Otvet ne prišel                 Otveta ne prišlo
      Answer-NOM.M.SG NEG came-M.SG   Answer-GEN.M.SG NEG came-N.SG
      'The answer didn't come.'       'No answer came.'
* Intransitive GenNeg sentences are always “impersonal”: the verb is always N.SG
* Babby (1980) introduced the terminology
  * “Negated declarative sentences” (NDS), for the sentences with nom subj, 3a
  * “Negated existential sentences” (NES), for those with genitive “subjs", 4a
  * The corresponding affirmative sentences (ADS and AES) are in (3b) and 4b
  (3) NDS (a) Otvet iz polka ne prišel
              Answer-NOM.M.SG from regiment NEG arrived-M.SG
              'The answer from the regiment has not arrived.'
    ADS (b) Otvet iz polka prišel
            Answer-NOM.M.SG from regiment arrived-M.SG
            'The answer from the regiment has arrived.'
  (4) NES (a) Otveta iz polka ne prišlo
              Answer-GEN.M.SG from regiment NEG arrived-N.SG
              'There was no answer from the regiment.'
      AES (b) Prišel otvet iz polka.
              Arrived-M SG answer-NOM.M.SG from regiment
              'There was an answer from the regiment.'
* ES subj position
  * An affirmative AES obligatorily has a postverbal subject, while in a
    negative NES, where the diff is marked by case, the word order vary
  * NES's are impersonal, but not AES's (Peškovskij, 1938)
    * Perlmutter and Moore (2002) consider even the affirmative counterps where
      the “subject” is necessarily nominative (Babby 2001)
* Examples (5-8) illustrate alternating pairs and
  cases where either Gen or Nom is obligatory.
  5 a. NDS: Stok talyx vod ne nabljudalsja
            Runoff-NOM.M SG melted water NEG was.observed-M.SG
            'No runoff of thawed snow was observed.'
    b. NES: Stoka talyx vod ne nabljudalos'
            Runoff-GEN.M.SG melted water NEG was.observed-N.SG
            'No runoff of thawed snow was observed.' (= There was no runoff.)
  6 a. NDS: Moroz ne čuvstvovalsja
            Frost-NOM.M SG NEG be.felt-M.SG
            'The frost was not felt.' (E.g. we were dressed warmly).
    b. NES: Moroza ne čuvstvovalos'
            Frost-GEN.M.SG NEG be.felt-N.SG
            'No frost was felt (there was no frost).'
  7 a. NDS: `*`(#) Somnenija ne byli
            Doubts-NOM.N.PL NEG were-N.PL
    b. NES: Somnenij ne bylo
            Doubts-GEN.N.PL NEG were-N.SG
            'There were no doubts.'
  8 a. NDS: Lena ne pela
            Lena-NOM.F.SG NEG sang-F.SG
            'Lena didn't sing.'
    b. NES: `*`(#) Leny ne pelo
            Lena-GEN.F.SG NEG sang-N.SG
* In addition to this “subject Gen Neg”, there is “object Gen Neg”, in which
  Accusative alternates with Genitive under negation
  * The semantic effect in that case, if any, is less well understood
  * Babyonyshev (1996); scope of negation
  * Chvany (1975), Perlmutter (1978), Pesetsky (1982) and most Western scholars
    treat the two as a single phenomenon, but no other common semantics than
    that Gen Neg happens only under scope of neg
* some Slavic languages, the phenomena diverge
  * Russian linguists generally view the two constructions as distinct, with
    subject Gen Neg having clear semantic motivation and object Gen Neg lacking

# 1. Babby on “Declarative” and “Existential” sentences 2

## 1.1. Information structure and the scope of negation

* Babby (1980): DS's and ES's differ in their “scope of assertion/negation”
  ```
  (9)           AFFIRMATIVE               NEGATED
  EXISTENTIAL   [_{Scope of A} VP NP]     [_ne VP NP_gen ]
  DECLARATIVE   NP [_{Scope of A} VP]     NP_nom [_ne VP]
  ```
* Thus the declarative sentence (5a) presupposes that there was some runoff
  * asserts that it was not observed, i.e. negates only that it was observed
* The corresponding ES (5b) is used to negate the very existence of any runoff
  * nabljudalsja 'was.observed' functions as a “weak verb” (“sem empty”)
    * “weak” or “empty” verbs was at the center of Borschev & Partee (1998a)
* Babby relates chart (9) to the categorical vs. thetic distinction
  (Kuroda (1972) discuss Brentano and Marty; von Fintel (1989), Ladusaw (1994))
* Babby's second main proposal is that
  the scope of assertion/negation can be equated with the Rheme of the sentence
  according to the division of the sentence into Theme and Rheme (or Topic & Fo)
  * Babby (2001) adds a syntactic layer of analysis so that
    morphology does not have to interface with information structure directly
  * AES or NES is a “rheme-only” sentence (plus optional thematic locative.)
  * Babby's (1980) rule of genitive marking in NES's
  (10) `[_Rheme V NP] ⇒ NEG [_ne V NP gen ]`
    Conditions: (a) NP is indefinite (b) V is semantically empty
  * ie If the subject does not escape from the VP via topicalization,
    and the verb can be an 'existential verb',
    then negation licenses Genitive marking of the subject and
    Existential Closure (Diesing 1992b) applies
* Borschev & Partee (1998a,b): existence is always relative to a “LOCation”,
  which may be implicit
* Jackendoff's (1972, 1990) metaphorical-structural extensions of “being in a
  location” to include “being in some state”, “occurring in some spatiotemporal
  region”, “being in someone's possession”,
  * we extending also to “being in the speaker's (or an observer's) perceptual
    field” (Padučeva 1992, 1997)
    => in ES, the LOCation, is semantically obligatory, and it is the Theme
  * either given or contextually presupposed
  * The assertion (Rheme) is that
    the/a “THING” described by the subject NP exists in that LOCation

## 1.2. Alternatives to Babby's analysis: Unaccusativity

* Babby (1980, 2001) claims that all subject Gen Neg sentences are existential
  * not all unaccusative verbs can occur with Gen Neg (see (11) from Babby 2001)
  * some unergative verbs can (see (12), Babby 2001, p.50)
  (11) Za vse vremja suda u nee na lice ne drognul ni odin muskul
       during whole time of-trial at her on face NEG twitched not one muscle.NOM
       'Not a single muscle twitched on her face during the entire trial.'
  (12)  ..., tam ne rabotaet ni odnogo inženera
        ..., there NEG works not one.GEN engineer.GEN
        'there hasn't been a single engineer working there'
* Proponents of the Unaccusative analysis,
  * Perlmutter (1978) and Pesetsky (1982) to Harves (2002)
  * argue that being an underlying direct object is necessary but not a suffic
    for the occurrence of Gen Neg, so
    (11) needs further explanation but is not a “counterexample”; they would
    * the verb has been shifted to an Unaccusative in (12)
* the semantics of the construction, which is our main concern
* Unaccusative sentences and Existential sentences share the property of
  “non-Agentivity”. We remain agnostic about the Unaccusativity requirement,
  * openness of the class of possible “genitive verbs”
  => this approach have permit verbs to shift in and out of Unaccusative class
* great many analyses of Gen Neg in the literature, too many to discuss
  * Western Slavists consider Unaccusativity at least a necessary condition;
  * few are explicit about the semantics of the construction other than that it
    occurs within the scope of sentential NEG
  * Babby and we: subject Gen Neg sentences are existential

## 1.3. Approaches to the semantics of the construction

* more about the semantics of the construction in Sections 2 and 3
* A Gen Neg subject is typically indefinite, but not always (Babby, Timberlake.)
* The verb in a Subject Gen Neg sentence must be 'semantically empty' (Babby)
* Intransitive Gen Neg sentences are Thetic (Babby)
  * authors appeal [fellebbez] to Diesing 1992b for
    the Nom/Gen alternation as VP-external/internal subject
* Gen Neg occurs in the scope of sentential negation (Partee & Borschev 2002)
* A Gen Neg NP (subject or object) has decreased referentiality and tends to be
  '(existentially) quantificational'
  (Jakobson, Timberlake, Babby, Neidle, Pesetsky, Bailyn)
* Especially for Object Gen Neg, many factors contribute to the (probabilistic)
  choice of Gen
  * decreased 'individuation' of NP, decreased transitivity of the verb
    (Timberlake, Mustajoki, Ueda)

# 2. Our approach: Existential vs. predicative and “Perspective structure” 5

## 2.1. It's not Theme-Rheme that distinguishes existential sentences

(13)  Sobaki u menja net. (Arutjunova 1976)
      dog-GEN.F.SG at I-GEN not.is
      I don't have a dog. [Context: talking about dogs]
(14)  [Ja iskal kefir.] Kefira v magazine ne bylo.
      [I looked-for kefir] Kefir-GEN.M.SG in store NEG was-N.SG
      [I was looking for kefir.] There wasn't any kefir in the store.'
      (Borschev & Partee 1998b, 2002)
* 13, 14: 'dog-GEN.F.SG ', and 'kefir-GEN.M.SG ' are in the Theme
* Both their natural intonation pattern and their default interpretation support
  this point of view and argue against the generalization in (10)

## 2.2. What distinguishes “existential sentences”? 5

### 2.2.1. Making Location part of the story

* Arutjunova (1976, 1997) distinguishes three components in a “classical”
  existential sentence:
  * a “Localizer” (“Region of existence”),  LOCation
  * a name of an “Existing object”, and     THING
  * an “Existential Verb”                   BE
* THING and LOC are roles of
  * could say: the verb byt' 'be', hE
  * better: the situation (or state) of existing or being located
* LOC may be given explicitly, as in (14), (15), or it may be implicitly
  * always understood with respect to some LOCation (possib implicit)
  * “existence is relative” principle: Existence is always relative to a LOC
* Which location (Borschev & Partee 1998a, 2002)

### 2.2.2. Existential sentences: LOC as Perspectival Cente 6

* two kinds of sentences
* discussed by many authors in many frameworks
* each having the parts we call “BE (THING, LOC)”, where
  * BE stands for any “potentially existential” verb which can be used in both
* existential sentence, it is as if the predication is somehow “turned around”,
  to assert of the LOCation that it has the THING in it
  * how and at what “level” of structure
  * Babby (1980); at the level of Theme-Rheme (or Topic-Focus) structure
  * Babby (2000); in syntactic structure, without taking a stand on the sem
  * Borschev & Partee (2002)
    * in addition to topic-focus structure there is a relevant
      'Perspectival Structure', relating to an often observed difference in
      predication in existential vs. predicational sentences
* Both types have a verb with two arguments we call THING and LOCation
  * unmarked structure, the THING is chosen as “Perspectival Center”
    * a predicational sentence
    * In an ES, the LOC is chosen as “Perspectival Center”
    * not only about existence but also 'coming into existence', 'being
      present', occurring, being in one's perceptual field, etc
    * it turns the predication around: ` LOC has THING in it`
    * If the LOC is implicit, this is a “thetic judgment”.
(17) PERSPECTIVE STRUCTURE:
  An “existence/location situation” BE(THING, LOC) may be structured from the
  perspective of the THING or of the LOCation
  * Perspectival Center := the participant chosen as point of departure
* An analogy may be made with a video camera and “what the camera is tracking”
  * A predicational sentence keeps the camera fixed on the protagonist
  * an ES is analogous to the way a security camera is fixed on a scene and
(18) PERSPECTIVAL CENTER PRESUPPOSITION:
  * Any Perspectival Center must be normally be presupposed to exist
* the subjects in NDS's are normally presupposed to exist, whereas
  in NES's, only the LOCation is normally presupposed to exist
* This is confirmed by examples like (19).
(19) a.   Petja na koncerte ne byl.           Koncerta ne bylo
          Petja-NOM at concert NEG was-M.SG   Concert NEG was-N.SG
          'Petja was not at the concert.      There was no concert.'
     b. Peti na koncerte ne bylo            #Koncerta ne bylo.
        Petja-GEN at concert NEG was-N.SG   Concert NEG was-N.SG
        'Petja was not at the concert       #There was no concert.'
* In the case of quantified NPs, the presupposition of existence becomes rather
  a presupposition that the domain of quantification is not empty
* The nominative subject in (20) presupposes the existence of a non-empty set of
  students who 'might have been there', whereas
* the genitive subject in (21) carries no such presupposition.
(20)
  [My nadejalis', čto na seminare budut studenty.]  No ni odin student tam ne byl
  [We hoped, that at seminar will.be students]      But NI one-NOM.M.SG student-NOM.M.SG there NEG was-M.SG.
  ['We hoped that (some of the) students would be at the seminar.] But not a single one of the students was there.'
(21)
  [My nadejalis', čto na seminare budut studenty.]  No ni odnogo studenta tam ne bylo.
  [We hoped, that at seminar will.be students]      But NI one-GEN.M.SG student-GEN.M.SG there NEG was-N.SG.
  ['We hoped that there would be students at the seminar.] But there was not a single student
                                  [or: not a single one of the students] there.'
* THE SEMANTICS OF NESs:
  An NES denies the existence of the thing(s) described by the subject NP in the
  Perspectival center LOCation. (not necessarily “in the world”)
* implicit Perspectival Center locations associated with implicit observers
  (23) the implicit Perspectival Center location is simply “the actual world,”
    yielding a literal denial of existence
  (23)  Edinorogov ne suščestvuet.
        Unicorns-GEN.M.PL NEG exist-SG
        'Unicorns do not exist.'
* (24) PRESUPPOSED EQUIVALENCE:
  * An NES presupposes that the following equivalence holds in the context
  * V(THING, LOC) ⇔ BE(THING, LOC)
  * If the GenNeg construction is used, the hearer uses contextual information
    to support existence, perhaps shifting the verb meaning to “less agentive”
  * “axioms” derive from
    lexical semantics, encyclopedic knowledge, and local contextual info
  * Examples in Section 3

## 2.3. Summary: Perspective and its role in Existential Sentences

* Perspectival structure is basically a structuring at the model-theoretic level
  like the telic/atelic distinction, or Agents/Experiencers
  * reflect cognitive structuring of the domains
    * not simply “given” by the nature of the external world
  * Correspondingly we find differences from language to language
* There are two kinds of descriptions of THING and a LOC situations
  * THING/LOC as Perspectival Center
  * THING => THING's existence is presupposed, and
      the sentence speaks of its LOCation and
      potentially about other properties or states or actions in the situation
  * LOCation as Perspectival Center, the sentence speaks about
    what THINGs there are or are not in that situation and
    potentially about what is happening in the situation
* has much in common with both
  * the choice of Theme (Topic)
  * the choice of grammatical Subject
  * all three notions
    involve structuring something (a situation, a proposition, or a sentence)
    so that one part is picked out and the rest is in effect predicated of it

# 3. What is perspective structure? Where in the grammar is it? 8

## 3.1. The camera metaphor

* not the same as information structure, although it has some similarity with
  * the Perspectival Center may by default also be the Topic: but not always, as
* not directly syntax, although it may well be reflected in the syntax. It seems
* a choice of what structure we want to impose on some piece of reality that we
  want to describe. And in this it has
* something in common with deciding whether to describe a buying or a selling
* similar in some ways to figure-ground choices, as in choosing whether to say
  eg A is above B or that B is below A

## 3.2. Diathesis shifts

* a broader theoretical context. Our current hypothesis about
  * 'where in the grammar' the choice of Perspective Structure is registered is
  * it is a “diathesis choice”, a choice among two alternative argument
    structures for verbs that can take both a “THING” and a “LOC” argument,
    analogous to the arg struct choices for spray, load or like give, send
    * For _give, send_ too there is a debate whether the diathesis alt is in
      semantics (Krifka 1999) or in information structure (Levin and Rappaport
      Hovav 2002))
* recent work on the semantics of diathetic alternations shares our goal of
  * integrating lexical and compositional semantics by exploring which 'axioms'
    are contributed by lexical semantics and which by the semantics of the
    constructions (Ackerman & Moore 2001, Bresnan 1994, Dowty 2001, Kiparsky
    1997, Krifka 1999)
* concept of diathesis originated in the Moscow School 8, and
  * Mel'čuk and Xolodovič (1970) and Xolodovič (1970) were the first to draw a
    distinction between voice and diathesis, using diathesis as the more general
    term for syntactic patterns of arg struct voice for diatheses marked on the
    verb (e.g.  active/passive)
  * continues to figure prominently in Russian lexical semantics (Padučeva 2002)
* the semantic difference between load the truck with hay and load the hay on t
  * no systematic truth-conditional difference, but there are oft-noted
  * differences in which argument is understood to be 'completely' affected: DO
  * direct object, which is also the one more likely to be a definite NP. Is
  * similar to our questions about the status of the THING and LOC arguments in
* current debates on diathesis alternation similar to our debate with Babby,
  about the relative contribution of topic-focus structure, lexical semantics,
  and the semantics of the syntactic structures
  * Levin and Rappaport Hovav (2002) and Yanko, Paducheva;
  * lexical items may select for the information-structure roles of certain of
    their arguments, in ways that
    may be connected to differences in presuppositional/assertional status of
    parts of their meanings
  * English dative alternation
    * Krifka (1999) and Levin and Rappaport Hovav (2002) disagree about the
    * Both believe that there is a real semantic difference in the spray/load
    * the syntactic direct object as the semantically “affected object” in the
    * But Levin and Rappaport Hovav believe that in the dative alternation,
      it's a matter of pragmatic implicature rather than semantic entailments
* differences between English and Russian “load”-type examples are considerable
  * English does more with syntax
    Russian makes much more use of the
    * derivational morphology of verbs – different prefixes, and (im)perfective
    * morphosyntax of the marking of the arguments
  * Ackerman and Moore (2001) believe that
    both verb-centered and syntax-centered diathetic alternations are possible,
    * Western theories may be helped by taking a more verb-centered perspective
* in the case of Gen Neg, sem diff in
  * not only the senses of the verbs when used with Gen vs. Nom (Section 3.3),
    or (less commonly but sometimes) with Gen vs. Acc, but we also find that
  * Gen < Nom “Subjects” score on tests of subject properties
    * tests include both the kinds of
      semantic properties by Hopper and Thompson (1981) and Dowty (1991) and
      syntactic tests proposed by Keenan (1976). Keenan's and similar tests have
      * discussed with respect to Russian by Babby (1980); Testelets (2001)
* But the fact that this alternation occurs only in negative sentences makes it
  different from many familiar diathetic shifts; we return to this issue

## 3.3. Evidence for lexical shifts: semantic “bleaching”

* lexical verbs have their normal meanings, whatever those are. Then we ask:
* what types of further axioms holding for the given S in the given context,
  * may come from the dictionary, from common knowledge, or from
    particular contextual information or inferences
* A few examples are given below, but we omit discussion here

### “Dictionary axioms”
(25)

a. NES: Ne belelo parusov na gorizonte.  on horizon
        NEG shone.white-N.SG sails-GEN.M.PL
        'No sails [vitorla] were shining white on the horizon.'
b. Presupposed Equivalence:
  'A sail shone white on the horizon.' <==> 'There was a sail on the horizon.'
c. 'Dictionary axiom' (part of lexical semantics):
  to shine-white <==> to be white (in the field of vision)
d. Dictionary or encyclopedic axiom; 'common knowledge':
  'Sails as a rule are white.'

### Dictionary + contextual axioms

* an example in which the equivalence is less expected.(26)
  NES: Ne belelo domov na gorizonte
       NEG shone.white-N.SG houses-GEN.M.PL on horizon
       'No houses were shining white on the horizon.'
* acceptable only if the hearer can accommodate the assumptions that
  all houses in the region are white

### Axioms about characteristic actions or states for given kinds of things

* Gen Neg + 'semantic bleaching' often depends on the V Subj combi
(27)
  Example (27a) is a NES, (27b) a NDS for contrast.  (27)
a. NES V našem lesu ne rastet gribov. (Babby 1980, p. 66)
       In our forest NEG grows-SG mushrooms-GEN.M.PL
       'There are no mushrooms growing in our forest.'
* form for axiom: for a mushroom to exist (in a forest) is for it to perform a
  characteristic action or be in a characteristic state (in that location)
b. NDS (Babby 1980) Zdes' daže trava ne rosla
                    Here even grass-NOM.F.SG NEG grew-F.SG
                    'Even grass couldn't grow here'

### “Genitive” verbs

* which verbs can be “genitive” and the nature of their “weakness.” What we
  * NES's may contain any verb which in a given context is equivalent to be
    (or appear - “begin to be,” etc.)
* If we take V <=> BE as a presupposition of the construction, associated with
  * the resultant “semantic bleaching” of these verbs as a coerced lexical shift
* Some of these shifts may be lexicalized;
  * discussion of Mel'čuk's 'lexical functions' in Borschev & Partee (1998a)
* When the presupposed equivalence is inconsistent with
  presuppositions of the verb or of other parts of the sentence, or with
  our representation of reality, or with our suppositions about the given contxt
  then the NES construction is impossible
* factors making such a lexical shift easier or harder (Timberlake, Ueda)
* And conversely, some verbs “demand” genitive,
  * the verb's meaning directly entails equivalence with be. With such verbs,
  * eg suščestvovat' 'to exist'
  * the nominative is
    * normally impossible: compare the impossible (28) with the normal (23)
    * possible only in special cases involving non-standard “Locations”, as
      illustrated in (29) (examples from Elena Paducheva, personal comm)
(29) a. Ženščiny dlja nego ne suščestvujut
        Women-NOM.F.PL for him NEG exist-PL
        'Women for him do not exist.'
  b. Ženščin dlja nego ne suščestvuet
     Women-GEN.F.PL for him NEG exist-SG
     'Women for him do not exist.'
* nominative in (29a) is marked, and signals the speaker's presupposition that
  in the actual world, women do exist. The use of the expected genitive in (29b)

## 3.4. Why only under negation?

* why the Nom/Gen and Acc/Gen alternations occur only in negative sentences 9
  * a point on which Slavic languages differ
  * Serbian/Croatian shows Nom/Gen alternation in both affirmative and negative
    * only with the verb be (Wayles Browne and Tijana Ašić, p.c.)
  * problem in different ways for different approaches, and accounts for the
  * For a diathesis-based account; how the verb and the negation are related
* Babby's 1980 account was explicit but stipulative: a construction
* Pesetsky (1982);
  the Gen Neg NPs were all headed by a null NPI quantifier, which itself
  received the expected Nom or Acc case of its subject or object position, but
  assigned Gen to its complement, as many Russian quantificational heads do
  * offered insight into the semantic property of 'decreased referentiality'
  * problems with the fact that Gen Neg NPs are not always bare indefinites;
    they may have explicit quantifiers of their own (which then show up with
    Genitive case, not Nom or Acc), as in (21), and they may be headed by
    demonstratives, or be proper names, as in (19b)
* tempting to posit a 'negated verb' with its own diathesis shift
  * There are languages with
    * separate negated verbs, especially negations of 'be' or 'have',
      with their own argument structure, and
    * in many Slavic languages,
      sentential negation is marked with a preverbal clitic or even a prefix
* Bailyn (in press)
  * a number of accounts have foundered on the fact that
    the same negation that licenses Gen Neg only on the direct object of
    transitive verbs or the subject of some intransitive verbs
    also licenses NPIs (including negative concord n-words) in higher positions
    such as subject of a transitive or unergative verb
  * sentential Neg, in a relatively high position itself, licenses or checks a Q
    feature on the verb, and that Q-marked verb may select for a genitive
    internal argument
    * That account has some features in common with
      * Pesetsky's original idea, and also with
      * the idea of Jakobson (1971/1936), modernized in Neidle (1982, 1988),
        * genitive NPs are in some sense more quantificational than referential
* we; the verb shifts under negation to Neidle's/Bailyn's Q-marked verb, which
  is an NPI alternant of the original verb

# 4. What is the relation between Subject Gen Neg and Object Gen Neg? 13

## 4.1. Different but similar diathesis shifts

* Gen Neg applies only to underlying internal arguments (direct objects),
  * Pesetsky (1981) and Neidle (1982, 1988)
  * we are not so certain, and our Russian colleagues remain skeptical
* Western Slavists (other than Babby) start from Object Gen Neg and see
  Subject Gen Neg as a derivative phenomenon involving only 'apparent' subjects
* no account of the “existential” interpretation of Subject Gen Neg sentences
* Russian linguists are more inclined to see
  * Subject Gen Neg as a property of existential sentences
  * diff analysis to apply to Object Gen Neg sentences, which are not existal
* both alternations involve a demotion of the corresponding argument:
  * a genitive subject/obj is not a first-class subject/obj, and a genitive object is
  * But perhaps because objects are more closely dependent on the verb,
    the semantic effects of
    Object Gen Neg are variable, while the semantic effects of
    Subject Gen Neg fall into just one or two strong patterns,
    the existential type that we have mainly explored, and
    the _ni odin_ type mentioned in footnotes 5 and 6
* A problem for approach that takes
  Object Gen Neg as basic and extends it to Subject Gen Neg via the Unaccus hypo
  * why some but not all passive sentences allow Gen Neg subjects
* With the verb polučit' 'receive', we find parallel behavior and interpretation
  between the object and a passive subject, illustrated in (30)
(30) a. On ne polučil pis'ma
        he NEG received letter-GEN.N.SG
        'He didn't receive any letter.'
  b. Pis'ma ne bylo polučeno
     letter-GEN.N.SG NEG was-N.SG received
     'No letter was received.'
  c. On ne polučil pis'mo
      he NEG received letter-ACC.N.SG
      'He didn't receive the letter.'
  d. Pis'mo ne bylo polučeno
     letter-NOM.N.SG NEG was received
* All are good, and
  the interpretations are parallel:
  Acc/Nom presupposes existence of the letter,
  Gen suggests no letter exists
* But that is not true for all transitive verbs
(31) a. Ja ne čital ètoj knigi
        I NEG read this-GEN.F.SG book-GEN.F.SG
        'I didn't read this book.'
  b. `*`Ètoj knigi ne bylo pročitano
      this-GEN.F.SG book-GEN.F.SG NEG was-N.SG read-N.SG
      (Intended meaning: 'This book wasn't read.')
* Our hypothesis about why the Gen is possible/not for the passive subject of
  polučen(o) / pročitan(o) is that
  * the passive predicate polučen(o) is a bleachable 'existential' predicate
    similar to prišlo
    * doesn't presuppose the existence of its subject,
    * just as polučit' doesn't presuppose the existence of its object
  * Pročitan(o), on the other hand,
    cannot be construed as an existential predicate;
    it presupposes the existence of its subject
* needed; much more study of transitive verbs of different semantic classes
  * this piece of data seems to constitute one argument against the Unacc Hypoth
  * UH predicts that
    whenever the object of a transitive verb can occur in Gen Neg,
    the subject of the corresponding Passive should be able to occur in Gen Neg
  * But if the Subject Gen Neg rule and the Object Gen Neg rule have partly
    different conditions, with
    only Subject Gen Neg crucially demanding an “existential” reading,
    then one can account for the semantic licensing of passive Subject Gen Neg
    by the “existential reading” (bleachability) that some passive predicates
    have and others don't

## 4.2. A possible type-shifting approach to a 'demotion diathesis pattern'

* Hypothesis: Wherever we see Nom/Gen and Acc/Gen alternation
  (both under negation and under intensional verbs),
  * Nom or Acc represents an ordinary e-type argument position ('referential';
    of course it may be quantified, etc.,), whereas a
  * Gen NP is always interpreted as property-type: `<e,t>`, or `<s,<e,t>>`
* A related hypothesis is that
  with the transitive analog of the existential sentence, and with verbs that
  have intensional objects ('ždat' 'expect, wait for', mentioned earlier), the
  'genitive variant' of the verb has a (possibly implicit) situation argument
  which is higher ranked in some sense than the direct object,
  causing the direct object to be demoted, although it doesn't necessarily stop
  being object

When the direct object is 'demoted', the structure does not provide a
(situation-relative) existence presupposition, and the Genitive object may get a
non-specific or a 'property' reading. In the Acc-taking structure, the (Acc) object
is in canonical position, and the argument carries a (situation-relative) existence
presupposition
In a Diesing-style (Diesing 1992b) approach (Babyonyshev 1996, Brown 1999), the
Gen-object version might be the default, with the option of raising the object
out of the VP (for Acc)
On the lexical perspective this correlates with a change in verbal valency: When
the verb is negated, it takes a 'weaker' kind of object, marked by Genitive

In the case of the intensional verbs like ždat' 'expect, wait for' in (34), one
can argue that there is a shift in verb sense
correlated with the shift in the interpretation of the object
So part of the hypothesis should be that
the verb selects for the type of its object
(32) a. On ždet podrugu.  (Neidle 1988, p.31)
        He waits girlfriend-ACC.F.SG
        'He's waiting for his girlfriend.'
  b. On ždet otveta na vopros
     He waits answer-GEN.M.SG to question
     'He's waiting for an answer to the question.'

Neidle (1988, p. 31) notes that
  * verbs that lexically govern the genitive in Russian, optionally or
    obligatorily, “tend to be verbs of desire, aim, request, or achievement.”
    When there is a choice,
    * Accusative is used for a specific or generic object, indicating that the
      object is outside the scope of the semantic action of the verb
    * The Genitive is normally used when object is indefinite (existentially
      quantified) and within the scope of the verbal “operator”
  * there can be different ways of characterizing the difference: in terms of
    * relative specificity of the NP object, or in terms of
    * “the specification of the NP either within or outside of the scope of V"
  * in either case we are looking at differences in interpretation “associated
    with differences in the scope of the operation that I will refer to as
    'specification'

* The idea that such differences may reflect type differences
  * relates closely to the work of Zimmermann (1993), who argued for an
    alternative to Montague's treatment of intensional verbs
  * Montague treated verbs like ždat' `expect` as
    taking type `<s,<<e,t>,t>>` arguments,
    i.e. intensions of generalized quantifiers
  * Zimmermann; that they rather take type `<s,<e,t>>`, properties of entities
  * BHP had resisted that idea for some time because of sentences like
    “The police were looking for every witness to the crime”, which does allow
    an intensional reading for its clearly quantificational object, but overall
* connection is to the work of Helen de Hoop (1989, 1990, 1992, 1995). She
  * de Hoop; distinction between “weak case” and “strong case” for direct
    objects in Germanic languages, with both syntactic and semantic properties
  * Objects with “strong case” can move to topic position, can escape the scope
    of various operators, and are interpreted as e-type (or as generalized
    quantifiers if they are quantified)
  * Objects with “weak case” cannot move far from the verb; they
    have to stay inside the VP, and consequently they fall under the scope of
    any operators that affect the VP. And they are
    interpreted quasi- adverbially: they are of a
    type to take a transitive verb as argument and give an intransitive VP
    * This part of the proposal is slightly weak, because
      their adverb-like meaning appears to be just a type-lifted version of an
      existentially quantified argument-type meaning
    * they are thereby restricted to having narrow scope indefinite meanings
      * relates also to Diesing's work (Diesing 1992a,b, Diesing & Jelinek 1993)
* a similar connection to van Geenhoven (1995, 1996, 1998a,b), who
  * van Geenhoven treats 'weak' object NPs in West Greenlandic as “incorporated
    to the verb”: they are
    not fully independent objects, but get an existential quantifier from the V
* Yet another connection, and part of our immediate inspiration, is to the work
  * Ackerman and Moore (2001):
    variation in the semantic type of the object could be a species of
    diathesis, even if they are considered direct objects in both cases
  * “diathesis” should not be restricted only to cases where the actual
    grammatical relation changes, as in shifts from object to oblique,
    but also extended to cases where a subject or object remains subject or
    object but is 'weakened'
    eg the Accusative/Partitive alternations in Baltic languages among their
* look more closely at all the actual arguments invoked in these various anals
  * which of them resonate with Russian Gen Neg and Russian objects of intens Vs

Now let us return to the issue of Subject Gen Neg and Object Gen Neg
and connect the speculations above, which have mainly concerned Acc/Gen
alternations, with Subject Gen Neg

Given that we have analyzed Subject Gen Neg as always involving
existential sentences, in the past we had trouble seeing how we could extend a
comparable treatment to Object Gen Neg, since only in a small subset of cases
does Object Gen Neg involve anything like “existential meanings”: it seems to in
(32a), but not in (33a), for instance. But if we study the arguments of McNally
(1992, 1997, 1998) and recent work of Landman (2002), and ongoing work by
Kamp and Bende Farkas, they all have argued that
the NP in an existential sentence does not have normal type e (nor generalized
quantifier) meaning, but rather a property type meaning (<e,t> or <s,<e,t>>)
We have resisted that so far, because BHP has argued that that's the type for
the predicate of copular sentences and NOT the type for the NP in existential
sentences. But we could be wrong. Or this distinction in semantic types could be
too rough to capture all the semantic distinctions that really need to be made

If we could find more support for the arguments that
the NP in an existential sentence is interpreted as property type <e,t> whereas
  * We will say <e,t> for simplicity even though it may really be <s,<e,t>>
the subject position of a predicative or other ordinary sentence is type e,
then the parallel between Subject Gen Neg and Object Gen Neg would be at a
structural level: in each case the relevant argument is “demoted” from e-type to
<e,t>-type, with syntactic and semantic consequences
* The extent of the syntactic consequences apparently varies from language to l
  * may vary within a language for Subjects vs. Objects; on many views,
  * the Russian Gen Neg subject is no longer subject, but the Gen Neg object is
    still an object, although a 'weakened' one

# 5. Concluding remarks 17

* In the Subject Gen Neg case, the Perspectival Center status of the LOCation
  and the corresponding demoted-subject status of the THING are both marked
  choices
  * A languages differ
    * some make the LOCation the subject
      * align subject and Perspectival Center, and syntactic predicate with what
        is predicated of it; that would represent a
      * full 'syntacticization' of the distinction. On the other hand, there may
    * others fit perfectly Babby's analysis of Russian, where
      the existential sentence was realized just by
      making the Perspectival Center the Theme and
      the rest of the sentence the Rheme
    * Russian seems to do something in between
      syntactic characterization is still not clear, but
      the LOCative has some subject-like properties, and
      the THING lacks many typical subject properties,
      perhaps because it is type-shifted to a property type
* The semantics of Object Gen Neg is less clear, and we have not given a full
  * Object Gen Neg as also involving a sort of diathesis shift, in which
    the negated verb may have a somewhat different semantics and diathesis frame
    than the corresponding non-negated verb:
    a decrease in transitivity properties, a decrease in referentiality of its
    direct object, and very often a removal of an existence presupposition. We
* both Subject Gen Neg and Object Gen Neg may involve
  type-shifting the NP argument to a property type, which may be able to account
  for a number of the semantic correlates of the Gen Neg rule, and may help to
  link this investigation with other investigations of 'weak' objects
  (de Hoop 1995, Van Geenhoven 1998a, Zimmermann 1993)
* This construction is interesting
  * only in its own right for the many puzzles it presents; it is also a good
  * for the interactions among lexical semantics of verbs, argument structures
    and their “rearrangements”, the notion of existential constructions, and the
    pragmatics of assertion, negation, and presupposition. We are sure that we
