# Abstract

* Depression is a major public health concern in the US and globally
  * successful early identification and treatment can help health and behavior
  * remains undiagnosed, untreated or undertreated due to several reasons,
    including denial of the illness as well as cultural and social stigma
* social media platforms, millions of people express their thoughts, moods,
  emotions, and even their daily struggles with mental health on social media
  * Unlike traditional observational cohort studies conducted through
    questionnaires and self-reported surveys
* we explore the reliable detection of depressive symptoms from tweets
  * multimodal social data to discern depressive behaviors using
    a wide variety of features including individual-level demographics
  * developing a multimodal framework and employing statistical techniques to
    fuse heterogeneous sets of features obtained through the processing of
    visual, textual, and user interaction data
  * we significantly enhance the current SOTA approaches for depression identif
    * (improving the average F1-Score by 5 percent) as well as
      facilitate demographic inferences from social media
  * insights into the relationship between demographics and mental health
  * for the design of a new breed of demographic-aware health interventions
