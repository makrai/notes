* FCM is one of the most popular fuzzy clustering algorithms [141]. FCM can be
  regarded as a generalization of ISODATA
* A family of fuzzy-shells algorithms has also appeared to detect different
  * especially for contours in a two-dimensional data space. They use the
    “shells” (curved surfaces [70]) as the cluster prototypes instead of points
    or surfaces in traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms. In the case of
  * FCS [36], [70], the proposed cluster prototype is represented as a -di-
    mensional hyperspherical shell ( for circles), is the center, and is the
* Fuzzy set theories can also be used to create hierarchical cluster structure.
  * Geva proposed a hierarchical unsupervised fuzzy clustering (HUFC) algorithm
    [104], which can effectively explore data structure at different levels
* closely related to neural networks [24], and we will
see more discussions in the following section.
