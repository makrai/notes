# Description

* We evaluate two methods for precomputing such embeddings, BERT and Flair, 
  * four tasks: part-of-speech (POS) tagging, lemmatization, dep parsing, & NER
  * The first three tasks are evaluated on two corpora: 
    the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5 and the Universal Dependencies 2.3
  * NER is evaluated on the Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.1 and 2.0. We report
* SOTA results for the above mentioned tasks and corpora.
