# Abstract

* a joint model for performing 
  * unsupervised morphological analysis on words, and learning a
  * character-level composition function from morphemes to word embeddings. 
* Our model 
  * weights each segment according to its ability to predict context words. Our
  * comparable to dedicated morphological analyzers at the task of [segmentatn]
  * better than word-based embedding models at the task of syntactic analogy
  * incorporating morphology explicitly into character-level models help them
    produce embeddings for unseen words which [are better for word sim?]
