# 1 Locatives as evidence for an extro argument position

* This section presents a first set of data supporting a Davidsonlan treatment
* The following sentences illustrate some uses of spatial and temporal
  expressions in Germon.

# 2. _When_-causes; a second argument for the extra argumento position 7

* Thts time, the argument has to do with vari able btndtng, and it
  makes use of certain features of _Discourse Representation Theory_
  (Kamp 1961 , Heim 1962). Constder the foll owing sentences.
  `*`When Mary knows French, she knows i t well
  When a Moroccan knows French, she knows It well
  When Mary knows a foreign language, she knows I t we11
  When Mary speaks French, she speaks it we11
  `*`When Mary speaks French, she knows it we11
  `*`When Mary knows French, she speaks it well
* Following Kratzer (1976, 1966), I am assuming that, quite generally,
  the antecedents of conditionals just
  restrict the domain or some operator
  * This extends Lewis' treatment of _if_-clauses (Lewis 1975)
    in connection with adverbs of quantification to all types of conditionals
  * For an _if_-clause, the operator to be restricted can be
    a determiner quant, an adverb of quantification, or any kind of modal opor
  * hE, _When_-clauses don't seem to be able to restrict eplstemlc modals. Hence
16 (a) `*`When the 11 brary has this book, it must be on the second floor
   (b) If the library has this book, it must be on the second floor
* If _if "-clauses and "when_-clauses both restrict the domain of operators,
  we have to stipulate non-overt operators
  whenever a conditional sent introduced by _if_ or _when_ lacks an overt one
  * An adverb or quantification like _always_ or an epistemlc necessity operator
    are the available options (Kratzer 1966)
* If _when_-clauses cannot restrict epistemic modals, the non-overt operator in
  the sentences 15(a) to (f) must be _always_
* Following Lewis (1975), Kamp (1961) and Heim (1962), the analysis of 15(a) to
  (f) will now be as follows.
15' (a) `*`Always [knows (Mary, Fnmch] [knows well (Mary, French)]
    (b) Always_x I Moroccan(x) & knows (x, Fnnch)] [knows wen (x, French) I
    (c) Always_x (foreign l anguage(x) & knows (Mary,x)) (knows we 1 1 (Mary, x))
    (d) Always_I (speaks (Mary, Frenc h , l)) (speaks well (Nary, F re n c h, I))
    (e) *Aiways_I (speaks (Mary, French, 1)] [k n o w s well (Mary, French, I)]
    (f) `*`Always (knows (Mary, French)) \exists I [speak well (Mary, French, I)]
* all tripartite quantifier structures consisting of
  the quanti fier _atways_, a restrictive clause and a _nuclear scope_
  (Heim 1962)
  * The adverb of quan tification
    * is indexed with all those variables that occur free in its restrictive cla
    => it binds all free occurrences of these variables tn lts entire scope.
  * The nuclear scope of a trtparttte quant1fter construc tton ts closed by an
    existential operator binding
    all occurrences of variables in its scope which are not bound otherwise.
  * Indefinite noun phrases like _a Moroccan_ or _a foreign language_ are
    * not analyzed as existential quantifiers. They are treated as
    * predicates introducing a vari able into the logical representation
    * This vartable may then be bound by the quantifier _always_. For details of
    * Lewis 1975 and He1m 1982, Kamp 198 1 for an analogous approach.
  * contrary to assumptions tn Discourse Representation Theory,
    we didn't let proper names and referent ial pronouns introduce variables
    * or they do introduce variables, but these variables are "anchored" to the
      context of use, hence not available for binding. In what follows,
    * we will not be able to do justice to directly referential expressions.
* explain why sentences 15(a), (e), and (f) are ungrammatical. Assuming that
  * stage/Individual-level predicates do/not introduce a variable that can be
    bound by _always_, we predict that 15(a), (e), and (f) should be excluded,
    given the following natural proh ibi t i on against vacuous quantification
    (see Chomsky 1962 for a similar proposal).
  * Prohibition against vacuous Quanttrlcatlon
  * For every quantifier Q, there must be a variable x such that Q binds an
    occurrence o f x In both i t s restrictive clause and Its nuclear scope.
  * In 15(a), the main predicate in the antecedent and in the consequent Is
    lndlvidual-leve1. Hence there i s no Davidsonian argument Introducing a
    variable . No other expression In 1 5(a) Introduces variables. The sentence,
    then, Is excluded by the prohibition against vacuous quant i f ication.
  * 15(e) and 15(f) that lack a blndable variable In the consequent and In the
    antecedent respectively
  * 15(b) and (c) are good since variables are i ntroduced by I ndefinites in the
    antecedent and reappear again In the consequent
  * 15(d) contains the stage-level predicate _speak_ where 15(a) contains the
    * Introduce a free variable, but Individual-level predicates don't, 1 5(a)
      will , but1 5(d) will not violate the prohibition against vacuous
      quantification. Assuming that the prohibition against
* Why Is ~ good?
  * 16(b) good
  * 15(a), (e), and (f) as soon as we replace _when_ by _if_
  * _if _-clauses differ from _when_-clauses In being
    able to restrict eplstemic modals. In
  * 1 5(a), (e), and (f) all turn Into epistemic conditionals after the
    replacement
* 17(a), (b) and (c) correspond to 1 5(e), (e), and (f) respectively.
  If 11ary knows French, ahe knows i t well
  If Mary speaks French, she knows it well
  If Mary knows French, she speaks it well
* If 17(a) to (c) are eplstemic conditionals, the _if_-clause restricts an
  epfstemic modal
  * While some modals can act as quant ifi ers and bind variables as argued i n
    Heim (19B2), it seems that
    epistemtc modals cannot. Consider the following example:
(18) A car must be i n the garage
  * When _must_ Is Int erpreted deontlcally,
    the indertnlte noun phrase in (18) can have an existential or a universal
    (generic) Interpretation.
    * On Helm's account, the uni versal reading or _a car_ Is due to the modal
      _must_ that can function as a universal quantifier just like _always_.
      On this readrng, (18) woUld be represented as follows.
      (18') `Must_{x,l} (car(x) & be (x,l)) (in the garage (l))`
    * If _a car_ i s understood existentially, the logical representation would be
      (18").  `Must_{\exists x,l} (car(x) & be(x,l) & in the garage (l))`
      * only well-formed if the modal _must_ I s not __necessarily__ a quanttff er.
      * Otherwise, i t would be ruled out by the proh18ition against vacuous
        quantificati on
      * conclude, then, that deont1c modals are only optionally quantHtcational
  * When _must_ i s I n terpreted epistemically,
    _a car_ In (18) cen only be I nterpreted existentially
  * This suggests that epistemic modals
    are never quanttr1ers and can therefore never bind variables
  * But if epistemlc modals are not quanttrters,
    17(a) to (c) don't violate the prohtbttton against vacuous quantification.

# 3. A synt argument for the extra argument position in stage-level preds 12

## (a) Extraction facts from German

* configurational sentence structures with VPs are plausible for many languages
  including Japanese (Saito 1985) , German (Webelhuth1985 tmd dissertation In
  progress), Breton, Niuean, Chamorro, J21c21itec, Papago, and Warlptrt
  (Wool ford 1966). Most of this work also converges on the conclusion that
  * VPs may contain deep-structure subjects
    even if their aeads are not unaccusatlve verbs
    (Koopman & Spbrtiche 1985, Kuroda 1985, Kitagawa 1986, Tatetshi I988, Olest)
  * These subjects are claimed to appear in the specifier position of VP
    * They may stay there In surface-structure if they can get case there
  * The specifier position of VP Is the highest position within the VP. It ts
    * the customary object posttton, which Is the posttton adjacent to v.
  * the structure of simple sentences Is usually assumed to be as shown I n
    (19). IP -> NP I'   (IP = S, NP = spec IP)
          I' -> I VP
          VP -> V' NP   (NP = spec VP)
          V' -> V NP
* Diesing (1988)
  * certain extraction facts from German (Kratzer, 1988) can be explained I f we
    assume that at the relevant level of representation, subjects of
    * stage-level predicates are within VP, while subjects o f
    * individual - l evel predicates are I n the specifier of lP position. Whi l
  * common essumption
    * thet the level for genenal izDtions Dbout the realization of arguments is
      deep-s tructure (rather than logical form, for example). The
* two examples i l l ustrating the kind of facts relevant for what we might call
20(a) weil uns viele llebe Nachbarn hal fen
      s i nce us many de21r neighbors helped
      since many dear neighbors helped us
(b) Liebe Nachbarn halfen uns vlele
    dear neighbors helped us many
    As for dear neighbors, many or them helped us
2 I (a) weil das viele liebe N&chbarn verstehen
        since this many dear neighbors underst&nd
        since many dear neighbors understand this
    (b) *Liebe Nachbarn dear verstehen das vtele
         neighbors understand this maay
         As for dear neighbors, many or them understand this
* called _quantifier spl i t _ construction i n German. The
  * (a) subordinate c l auses w i t h unsp l i t quanti fier phrases. In the
  * (b) verb second has taken place and the quanttfler phrase I s sp1 t t
  * (20) Involves a stage-level predicate,
    (2 1) corresponding has an Individual-level predicate
* Quan t t f l er spl i t ts
  possible/impossible with subjects of stage/individual-level predicates, but
* Diesing proposes an ECP explanation for those facts, and we w i l l follow her
  * the quantifier split construction i s the resuit of
    movtng a common noun phrllse out or its NP as argued by Riemsdijk (1967)
  * subjects of lndtvtelual-level predicates are base-generated tn spec IP
    * They w l 1 1 then have several opttons at surface-structure.
    * stay in their original posttton, or else may
    * scramble, that is, adJoin to IP
    * In either case, they are ungoverned
    => movement from subjects of individual-level predicates will alwayi lead to
    an ECP violation. (Subjects of individual-l evel predicates can also appear
    in the specifier of CP position. We may assume that taey may optionally be
    balse-genenlted there.)
  * subjects of stllge-level predicates, suppose that
    they are base-generated withtn VP. They,
    * several opttons at surface-structure. They may
    * stay i n their original position. In this case, they are
      * in a governed position and movement from such subjects wfll not lead to
        an ECP violation
    * move on to the specifier of IP position. or scramble, they w i l l occupy
      an ungoverned position. Movement from such subjects, then, will 8gain
      violate the ECP
      * we expect to find cases where movement from those subjects is
        * possible.  20(b) is such a case. We also expect that, sometimes,
        * impossible. This expectation is borne out as illustrated by the
22(a) weil viele liebe Nachbarn einem alten Ehepaar halfen
      since many dear neighbors an old couple helped
      since many dear neighbors helped an old couple
(b) `*`Liebe Nachbarn ha1fen viele einem alten Ehepaar
      dear neighbors helped many an old couple
      As for dear neighbors, many of them helped an old couple
* extraction posstb1 1 t t i es for relat1ve clauses.
  (23) involves a stage-level pred1cate, (24) an individual-level predicate.
  Subjects of stage/individual-level predicates permit/not the extraposfUon of a
  relative clause
(23) weil zwei Kinder hier waren, mit denen niemen spielen wollte
     since two chl ldren here were, with whom nobody play wanted
     since two children were here with whom nobody wanted to play
(24) `*`well zwei Bücher teuer waren, die niemand lesen wollte
      sfnce two books expensive were that nobody read wanted
      since two books were expensive that nobody wanted to read
* In the following section, I am going to show that
  our assumptions concerning the argument structure of the two types of preds
  plus some plausible additional premises will allow us to derive a result that
  is almost Diesing's conjecture (as modffjed above). In perticular, we will be
  * subjects of stage/individual-level predicates are always base-generated
    * within/outside the maximal proj ection of their predicates.
    * outside of the maJximlll projection of their predicates,
  * unless the predicates are unaccusatlves (tn the sense or Perlmutter I 976) .

## (b) Deriving_(almost) Diesing's conjecture

The reasoning in this section will closely follow the structure of an
Zargument given in Wl11 iaJms (1961). Willillms llrgues thllt i n
nomin<JliZaJtlons lllce _cae s ar' s destruction of the city_, the agent
argument _caesar_ may be realized within the maximal projection of
_destruction_, since nomlnall zatlons_ like "destruction_ have an
event argument. C onsequent l y, the event argument, and not the agent
argument is the external argument here.
Following W i l l i ams, let us assume that the argument structure of

lexical i tem s consists of a ltst of thematic role labels like _agent_,
_expert encer_, •theme•, _goliJ_. Let us assume furthermore that we

also h<Jve <J Davidsonian thematic role, I n our case a role for

spatlotemporal location . At most one of the thematic role labels of

a predicate may be underlined. The underlined label corresponds to
the external argument of the predicate. All other arguments are

Internal. There may be some general izations a s to which argument of
a lexical item wtJJ wind up as its external argument. Hera are some
candidates: If a predicate has a Davldsonian argument, It w i l l always

be its externlll argument. If ll predicate has no DliYidsontlln argument,
but an agent argument, the agent argument will be its external
I

argument. The arguments of a predicate are ltnked to their syntact i c
positions tn deep-structure according to the following principle.
Argument l i nking_(Wi lliams >.

In deep-structure, all arguments except the external argument are
realized withln the maximal projection of their predicate.
There m<Jy be further principles guiding the realization of internal

arguments. Maybe Internal agent arguments have to occupy the
specifier position, while interna! theme arguments have to occupy
the obJect position, for example. This may lead to a more
hierarchical view of argument structure as proposed In Grtmsht5W
(1987), among others. There w i l l also be principles regulating case
assignment and agreement. All of these issues are addressed In the
11 terature mentioned above, so we w111 not go into details here.
Let us now look at some examples illustrating poss18le argument
structures for dHferent types of predicates.
(25)

Indivi dual-level predicates that are unaccusatives

The above examples are at best suggestive. We have seen that the
stage-level /Individual-level distinction Is context-dependent and
vague. And the distinction between predicates that are unaccusatives
and those that are not Is l i kewise unstable. What Is Important here is
that there are prototypical examples. And that we know which
factors contribute to context-dependency and vagueness. And that
whatever kind of vagueness and context-dependency we mey find w t l l
be transmUted to all the grammatical phenomena I n which the t w o

play a role.
Let us now look lit the predictions mllde by these lexitlll
representations In conjunctton with Wi ll tams· 1 1 nklng rule. All
stage-level predtcates have an external argument for spattotemporal
location. In languages 11ke Engltsh or German, this argument seems to
be implicit, that ts it has no realization at deep- or
surface-structure. As a COf'!Sequence, spattal and temporal
expressions are adjuncts. They don't ftll argument positions. All but
the event argument of stage-level predlcates are internal, hence they
have to be rel!ltzed within the mllximal projection of the predicate tn
deep-structure. Subjects of stage-level verbs, then, are always
base-generated tnside of their VP, subjects or stage-level adjecttves
are always base-generated withtn their AP and so on. This gtves us
one part of Diesing's conjecture . Let us now turn to individual-level
predicates. Those predicates don't have a Davidsonian argument.
Hence some other argument may be external. If there ts such an
targument, it hDs to be bDse-genernted extemD11y, Dnd the usutal
option i s the specifier of IP position. If the predicDte ts
unaccusattve, tts subject will be base-generated withtn tts maxtmal
projectton . Indtvtdual-level predicates. then. may come in two
ktnds. One kind has external subjects in deep-structure and the other
ktnd has internal ones. This gives us a sltghtly different version of
the second part or Diesing's conjecture. The following data support
this revision.

subjects or these predicates are sitting in an ungoverned position.
But the (c) sentences are good for the unaccusattves _belong to_ and

governed position.
What we have seen In this section, Is that the presence of a
Oavidsonian argument can be held responsible fpr the fact that
subjects of stage-level predicates are always internal arguments and
are base-generated within the maximal projection of their
predicates. In a language 11ke German, they can receive case in their
deep-,structure position and can stay there. As a consequence,
extract I on from those subJects Is permitted. SubJects of
lndtvtdual-level predicates may or may not be external arguments.
Hence they may or may not allow extraction. Assuming , then, that
individual-level predicates and stage-level predicates differ i n
argument structure as proposed here, we can derive certain facts
about the syntactic behavior of their subjects, given independently
motivated assumptions about the link between argument structure
and deep- structure representations.

# 4. The dif ferent rel!dings of bl!re pl urllls 20

The work of Gregory Carlson has shown convincingly thllt the
distinction between stage-level and Individual-level predicates plays
a crucial role In the I n terpretation of bare plurals. Carlson's

particular approach to bare plurals faces some serious probl ems.
however, most of which are already raised I n his dissertation
(Carlson

1977). Various attempts to deal with those problems l e d to

various alternatives. In what follows, 1 will briefly sketch Carl son's
analysis as well as the most promising alternative proposal
developed Independently

by Karina Wilkinson (1966) and Claudie:a

Gerstner and Manfred Krl fka

(1967). I wt I 1 then pol nt out some

apparent d i f f i culties with Wilkinson's and Gerstner and Krlfka's
approach and argue that a Davtdsonlan treatment of the
stage-levellindividualalevel distinction might help us to overcome
those difficulties.

On Carlson's analysis, bare plurals are always i nterpreted as names

of a kind. The logical

counterparts of English stage-level predicates

are predicates of stages. A stage Is a temporal 'sl tce' of an
individual. Since kinds are not the sort of entity to which a
stage-level property can apply, the relationship between kinds and
stage-level properties has to be mediated by a _realization relation_.

The counterparts of English individual-level predicates are
predicates of Individuals. IndivtduC!lls may be kinds or objects, a s
mentioned above. Individual-level properties, then, mc:ay c:apply to
kinds directly and no 'mediation; i s necessary. To Illustrate the
details

proposal, the logical counterparts of _attrutsttc_ and _avatlable_ are
both predicates with one argument. These arguments are of different
sorts. though.
(b) A Lewls/Kamp/Heim analysts
There are a number of problems with Carlson's proposal . Here is an
eMample (Htlsark 1974 . See also Carlson 1977 and Carlson
(forthcoming)).
(36)

Typhoons arise in this part of the Pacific

(36) has two reaomgs. It may mean that it Is a typical property or
typhoons that they arise in this part of the Pacific. Or else that i t is
a typical property of this part of the Pacific that there are typhoons
that arise there. Carlson's analysis only predicts the first of those
readings. The difficulty with the second reading is that the verb
_artse_ is understood generically, but the bare plural noun phrase
_typhoons_ can still get an existential reading. On Carlson's
proposal, the existential read1ng of a bare plural can only be provided
by a stage-level predicate. But 1f _artse_ tn (36) were translated as a
stage-level predicate, the resulting translation would mean that
typhoons are arising in this part of the Pacific. Difficulties of this
sort motivated Wilkinson (1986) and Gerstner and Krifka (1987) to
propose that at least certain kinds of bare plurals should be analyzed
along the lines of Lewis, Heim, and Kamp (see also Farkas & Sugioka
1963 for an earlier 21rticulatton of a similar view, and Schubert &

Pelletier 1987 for an overview and some further developments). The
two readings of (36) can now be represented as 36'(a) and (b).
G x [typhoon (x)J 311 t h i s part of thE Pactftc(t) &

36'(a)

arise i n (x,l) I
G1 lthis part of the Pacl flc(I)J 3 xltyphoon(x)
& arise in (x,I)J

(b)

These representations are quantifier structures of the sort discussed
above. _G_ Is some kind of adverb of quant1f1cat1on, a generic
operator l i k e _typically_, whose exact nature Is not at Issue here
(overt quantifiers like _always• or _usually-, may be substituted
without changing the point of the example). like other indefinites,
bare plurals are treated as predicates introducing variables into the
logical representation. The generic reading of _typhoons_ arises
when _typhoons_ appears in the restrictive clause of the quantifier
construction. In this posttton, th e variable Introduced by _typhoons_
can be bound by the non-overt generic operator. The existential
reading of _typhoons_ arises when _typhoons_ appears in the nuclear
scope Recall that the nuclear scope of a logical representation i s
always existentially closed (Kamp 198 1 , Helm l982). 1f the variable
that comes with _typhoons_ is Introduced in the nuclear scope, i t
wt11 be 'caught' by existential closure This Is the source of the ,
existential reading.

(c) Toomanyreadings? Dtestnnll.ala
Wilkinson (I 986) i s well aware that while her approach to bare
plurals I s successful i n predicting certain plausible readings of bare
plural sentences that carlson's analysts excludes, i t also runs the
risk of admitting some very implausible ones. This point Is taken up
in Diesing 1988. Diesing's main concern Is to predict the correct
range of tiVatlable readings for bare plurals. She proposes an analysts
of sentences with bare plurals that crucially exploits the fact that
subjects of stage-level predicates aM subjects of tMtvtdual-level
predicates may be in different positions at the relevant level of
representati on. I have argued above that this syntactic di fference is
i n fact a consequence of a difference in argument structure. If
Diesing's analysis of bare plural sentences is plausible, it can be

Firemen are avattal:lte

Diesing argues that a Lewis/Kamp/Heim approach (as advocated by

possible readings for a sentence like (37).

37'(a) says that there are firemen available. 37'(b) says that It Is a

Interpretation for (38). Diesing proposes a syntactic solution to this
problem. Her proposal says roughly that when sentences like the ones
we have been discussing so far are mapped into logical
representations, 'materllll' in the VP goes into the nuclear scope ,
while 'materi al' outside of the VP goes into the restrictive clause.
For a language like Engllsh, we can Implement Diesing's proposal as
follows.
While all subjects appear in the specifier of IP position at surface
structure, subjects of stage-level predicates and subjects of

have been moved from their deep-structure position within VP ,
leaving a trace. This distinguishes them from subjects of

Individual-level predicates that are not unaccusatlves. Those
subjects are base-generated in the specifier of IP position, hence
don't bind a trace within VP. Let us say that a subject In the
specifier of IP position that binds a trace within VP appears
'simultaneously' within and outside of the VP. When surface
structures ere mapped Into quentifter structures, those subjects mDy
then be mZipped into the restrictive clause or else into the nucle21r
scope. That the effects of NP movement can be optlona11y _undone_ tn

(1977) .

arises through 'undoing• the effects of NP movement at logical form.
Subjects of Individual-level predicates that are not unaccusatfves ,
then, 21re alwDys mapped into the restrictive cleuse . All other
subjects have 21n option. They may be mapped Into the restrictive
clause or Into the nuclear scope. We have seen that with1n a
Lewts/Kamp/Helm approach, bare plurals have no quanttftcattonal
force of their own. They only introduce a predicate and a variable
Into the logical representation. If they appear In the nuclear scope ,
the variable they introduce will be bound by existential closure.
Hence the existential reading. If they appear in the restrictive
clause , their vDrleble will be bound by e suitZible overt quenttffer or
by the non-overt generic operator. This is the source of the generic
reading. _Avatlable_ Is a stage-level predicate. Diesing's proposal
correctly predicts that a bare plural subject of _available_ may have
an existential or a generic reading. _Attrutstlc_ Is an Individual-level
predicate that Is not unaccusattve (as shown by the German
extraction facts). Diesing's proposal implies that a bare pl ural
subject or _aJtrutsttc_ cannot get an existential reading through
existentlel closure or the nuclear scope. If this propose! ts to
exclude the reading 3B'(b) for sentence (36), we must be sure that

nuclear scopes .
This is not Heim's or Kamp's view, however. For them, there i s a
second existential closure operation (or some analogue) affecting
texts. Problems with Kamp ano Helm's existential closure operation
for texts have been pointed out by Kadmon (I 987), using examples
like (40) (inspired by Evans 1977).

(40)

Harry vaccinates (as before, we are neglecttng all spectrlc aspects
of plurality).
H

(Harry.x) 1

To avoid this consequence, Evans proposes to treat pronouns like
_them_ in (40) as E-type pronouns. E-type pronouns are pronouns
that are anaphortcally related to quantifier phrases that don't
c-command them. They 3re interpreted lJS def1ntte descriptions ("the
sheep that John owns_). But 1f we treat pronouns ltlce •them_ above
as E-type pronouns, we can dispense with the exlstenttal closure
operation for texts altogether. This means that the only avail able
existential closure operation Is existential closure of the nuclear
scope. And it also means that a bare plural noun phrase that i s
base-generated outside o r the nuclear scope can never get an
existential reading. This is why 38'(b) Is not a possible reading for
(38).
01 est ng's proposa 1 a 1 so Imp1 1 es that subJects of unaccusatl ve
Individual-level predicates might get extstenttal readings. This
prediction i s borne out. Consider the following examples involving
the predicates _belong to_ and _be known to_ which patterned as
unaccusatives with respect to the German extraction data

Emphasizing the subjects favors an existential reading here. Note,
however, that emphasizing the subjt!ct In (36), will sttll not gtve.us
an existential reading. This suggests that whatever the precise role
of Intonation Is, It can only help us to choose among the options
provided by grammar.
It seems, then, that Diesing's slogan 'material in the VP is mapped
into the nuclear scope, material outside of the VP Is mapped into the
restrictive clause' may indeed be used as a first step towards
expltsining why sentences like (37) and (36) have the readings they
have.
Up to now, our discussion has rat sed two major Issues. The first
Issue had to do with syntactic differences between stage-level and
Individual-level predicates. We argued that the two types of
predicates differ in argument structure, and that this property may
result In a syntactic di fference concerning the position of subjects
In deep-structure. The second issue addressed the connection
between surftsce-structure VPs Md the· nucletsr scope of quenttfier
constructions at logical form. We argued that t t is nuclear scopes
and only nuclear scopes that can be existentially closed. As a
consequence, all existential NPs that have no quant1 f1cat1onal force
of their own have to appear in the nuclear scope at the level of
logical form. We found that those NPs are already restricted to
certain positions i n surface-structure, and this observation led to
the hypothesis that there I s a tight connection between surface '
structure VPs tsnd the nuclettr scope of quantifier representations.
The two issues are closely related, of course, with VP-external
versus VP-1nternal subjects providing the link.
In the remainder or this paper, I am go1ng to pursue both of those
issues further. We will look at a diverse body of data jointly
supporting the conclusions we have reached so far.

# 5. tie,gatlveQUantifiersInGerman I)

In German, plural negative quanttrler phrases show unexpected scope
interactions with modals (Bech 1955, Lerner and Sternefeld 1985).
Consider the following example.
weil keine Belspiele bekannt sein mussen
examples known be must
since no
since it Is not necessary that examples be known

(43)

H _keine Belsplele_ were a normal quantifier phrase, we would

expect that it Is nslsed at logical form (let us neglect the question of
how precisely quanti.fler raising interacts with the other proposals
of this paper) . And if the modal is raised as well, we should find the
following readings for (43), neglecting plurality, as usual.
43'(a) nox I uampldx) 1

IO known (x) 1

(O) o nox I example(x) J (known (x) J

43'(a) would give the quantifier phrase wide scope over the model.
43'(b) would represent the narrow scope reading. Sentence (43),.
however, hDs neither of these readings. The only reading of (43) is
:
represented oy 43'(c).
43'(c) not 0 3xiExample (x) & known (x) 1
1

This suggests that _lceine Beisplele_ is not a normal quantifier
phrase. It seems to be a particular realization of the string •nicht
Beispiele_, consisting of the negation adverb "nicht_ and the bare
plural _Belspiele_. The bare plural NP has to receive existential force
through existential closure. _Keine Beispiele_, then, involves two
operators: negation and the existential closure operator. A third
operator may Intervene. This Is what happens In (43) (for some
reason, the modal cannot have scope over the negation). If there ts no
other operator , _nicht_ and the existential closure operator jointly
give us the effect of _no•. That the true source of "keine N" is "nicht_
plus a bare plural noun is further supported by the following data.

44(a) shows that the negation adverb _nicht_ cannot appear adjacent
to a plural indefinite noun phrase. One way of accounting for this
fact is to assume that _nicht_ and the zero determiner have to
'mergea-so es to yield_-l!keine• es-shown- tn 44(b) (Bech's term_ for this
phenomenon i s _Kohaston_). In 44(c), the indefinite noun-phrase has
been moved away from tts deep-structure position. It 1s not adjacent
to _nicht_ anymore. The unmerged rorm can appear here, suggesting
that it Is indeed the unmerged forms that are Inserted
at deep-structure. The merging of _nicht_ with a zero determiner,
then, may be a rather superficial phenomenon, perhaps taking place at
the level of phonetic form.
There 1 s another argument showing that plural neget1ve quanttf ter
phrases In German originate from _nicht_ plus a bare plural NP.
Suppose that just ltke its Engltsh counterpart _not_, _nicht_ i s
base-generated somewhere between the subJect and the VP, the
usual position for sentence adverbs (an assumption l i ke this seems
justified in the light of Webelhuth (in progress)).
If _nicht_ is to merge with the zero detenntner of an adjacent bare
plural NP to its right, this NP has to be within VP. We now expect
that plural negettve quentlfter phrases in German must be
VP-internal, and this i s exactly what we find. Consider the foll owing
data.

Un11ke (43) above, sentence (53) has two readings. The first reading
is expected H _Jcein Beispiel_ is a 'true' quantifier phrase that i s
raised at logical form. For reasons that don't have t o concern u s
here, this quantifier phrase can only have wider scope than the modal
_muss_. The second readtng of (53) ts the reading that we
encountered with plural negative quantifiers. It requires "keln

and the lndertntte noun phrase _eln Beispiel_ . This reading Is given I n
53'(b). Since _ein Beispiel_ has n o quantlficattonal force of I t s own,
53'(b) involves the existential closure operator. The phrase •Jcein

resulting from _negation merging_. That singular Indefinites , too,
are subject to negation merging i s further supported by the fol lowing
ex21mples.

Unlike sentences (5 1) and (52), sentences (55) and (56) are fully

We have shown In this section that German plural negative quanttf1er
phrases provide another piece or evidence that stage-level predicates
and certain individual-level predicates (those that are not
unaccusatives) differ with respect to the base-position of their
subjects. We have also seen that existential closure plays a crucial
role in the i nterpretation of those _felse_ quentHier phn1ses. This
lends further support to the assumption that there i s a process of
existential closure tied to VPs.
The properties or plural negattve quantifier phrases In German are
reminiscient or the genitive of negation construction in Russian
(Babby 1980, Pesetsky 1982) . Further research will have to show

whether the genitive of negation phenomenon is amenable to an
analysts where an existential closure operation l i nked to VPs (rather
than quant1fter raising and the ECP as proposed by Pesetsky) carries
tile main burden of explanation.

# 6.  Objects and existential closure

We have seen that on Diesing's analysts, bare plurals (and other
indefinites without quantHicaUonal force) can be interpreted
existentlltlly only tf they end up in the nuclear scope ltt logical form.
This is where the variable they Introduce can be bound by existential
closure. We have also s·een that Dtestng assumes that qutte general ly,
VPs are mapped Into nuclear scopes. In a language l t k e English,
obJ.ects always appear within VP (we may neglect topica11zation).
We expect, then, that whenever a variable i s introduced by an
indefinite object in English, it w i l l be bound by existential closure
(Heim's Novelty Condition prevents it from being bound by any other
quantifier). As lt consequence, ltll indefinite objects should be
interpreted existentially . In what follows, I am going to show that
these predtcttons hold for some objects, but not for o thers. I w111
then argue that the matn features or Dlestng·s analysts can st111 be
maintained, provided we allow objects to be scrambled at logical
form.

might find 57(b) much more 21cceptable. But then you 21re talking
aoout a proof contatnlng mtstakes here right now or there a little btt
later. You are ustng _contatntng a mistake_ as a st8ge-level
predicate.
Why are the (b) sentences bad? The dfscusston of bare plurals in
sectton

slogan 'material outside of the VP goes Into the restrictive cl8use,

material inside of the VP goes Into the nuclear scope'. This
procedure (properly formalized) splits a sentence tnto two parts
when it Is mapped Into a logical representation. In the examples
discussed In earlier secttons, the two parts always ended up as the
restrictive clause and the nuclear scope of a tripartite quantifier
structure. This doesn't have to be the only possibllity, however.
Consider the following sentence.
(6 1)

Pedro has a donkey

If Diesing's proposal Is a general procedure for dividing sentences
Into two parts, (6 1) w111 be divided Into a restrictive clause and a
nuclear scope as well. Since there is no quantifi er, the result I s a
bipartite structure, rather than a tripartite one. Let us assume that
in cases like this, restrictive clause and nuclear scope are conjoined
by _&_. The logical representation of (6 1), then, might be something
like (6 1 ').
(6 1 ')

(be now (Pedro 3) I & 3 x I donkey (x) & have
(he3,x) I

In (6 1 '), _Pedro_ (with a suitable predicate, see section 7) appears in
the restrictive clause, since it ts realtzed outside of VP at
surface-structure. The VP itaalt is mapped Into the nuclear scope.
(Recall that there are insecurities concerning the treatment of
proper names and referential pronouns throughout this paper. In
(6 1 '), we use Indices to Indicate coreference between directly
referential expressions). If sentences like (6 1) are part of other
sentences, the corresponding logical forms might become rather
complex. We may now have embedded restrictive clauses and nuclear
scopes. Take sentence 60(b) from above. The antecedent of 60(b) is

Kratzer: Stage-Level and Individual-Level Predicates

(6 1). At the level of logica I form, (61 ') is the restrictive clause of
the whole sentence. But this restrictive cl ause contains another
restrictive clause and a nuclear scope as parts. The consequent of
60(D) Is mapped Into the nuclear scope or the whole sentence. This
nuclear scope is complex again, since the consequent of 60(b) Is split
up according to Diesing's slogan as well. The result Is something like
60'(b).

With existential closure binding the var1able Introduced by ·a
donkey_, the pronoun •it_ cannot be a bound variable. It Is then
I nterpreted as an E-type pronoun. E-type pronouns are Interpreted
as definite descriptions. That is, the E-type pronoun _it_ above is
analyzed as _the donkey Pedro has_ (for details see Evans 1977,
1980, Cooper 1979, Partee 1978. See also Kadmon 1987,
Heim 1987). 6 1 '(b) is not well-formed, since the quantifier
_always_ doesn't bind a variable.
Given representations of this kind, we expect the followi ng. Subjects
always have the possibility of becoming part of a restrictive clause.
As long as objects stay In their VP, however, they have;to go into a
nuclear scope. If nuclear scopes are existentially closed, variables
Introduced by Indefinite objects will be bound by the existential
closure operator. In all of the above sentences, then, variables
I
Introduced by tndeftnite objects are bound by existential closure,
wh11e variables Introduced by indefinite subjects are not. These
variables can now be bouno by the 1mpllctt adverb of qucmtlflcatton

Is well- formed I f no vacuous quan tiflcation occurs. Vacuous
quantHtcatton occurs In the (b)-examples, but not tn the
(a)-examples.
We have already discussed a (b)-example. A representative
(a)-example is 6 1 '(a), which has the following logical
representation.

6 1 ' (a) i s well- formed since the quantifier _always_ binds an
occurrence of _x_ in its restrictive clause and in tts nuclear scope.
As before, the pronoun _ t t _ is interpreted 8S 8n E-type pronoun.
Simply Interpreting _it_ as an E-type pronoun doesn't give us the

desired I nterpretation for 6 1 (a), however. 6 I (a) doesn't Imply that
whenever a farmer has a donkey, he has only one. Helm proposes to
treat this case as a case of presupposition accommodation (Heim
1983, Heim 1987, see also Lewis 1975). Quite generally,
presuppositions of the nuclear scope can be accommodated Into the
restrictive clause (nice examples are Schubert and Pelletier's

Pelletier 1967). After accommodatlng the uniqueness presupposition

The status of 6 1 ''(a) Is still controversial. Are we really considering
only those farmers who have exactly one donkey?

If all predicates in the antecedents of the conditionals 70(a) to (d)
llre indlvldulll-level prediclltes, the prohlbi tion aglSinst vacuous
quantification can only be satisfied If their Indefinite objects can
move Into the embedded restr1ctlve clause (of the main restr1 cttve
clause) when logical forms are constructed.
We have to assume, then, that i n Eng I ish, objects can sometimes
leave their VPs at the level of logical form. Transformations that
move objects out of their VPs have been studied for a number of
hmguages. These are the scrambling transformations that play a
crucial role tn configurational analyses of so-called
Mnon-coaftgurattonal· languages like Japanese (Satta 1965) or
German (Webelhuth 1985, Webelhuth (In progress), von 5techow and
Sternefeld 1966). Scrambltng is a transformation that adjoins a
constituent to IP (and maybe to other mal<imal projections). It is an
instance of _move cc _, hence has all the usual properties of
transformations. As a consequence, scrambling may move a
constituent out of VPs, but rt could nev-ermove a constituent Into
VPs, for example. If t t Is scrambling that saves sentences 62(a) to
(f), scrambling must be possible for some Indefinite objects, but not
for others. If scrambling were always possible, no tndef1ntte object
would have to be caught by el<lstentlal closure. Scrambling, then,
must dfscr1mfnate between 'well-behaved' and 'ill-behaved'
fndeftntte objects. If this is so, we expect that surface-structure
scrambling tn German and Japanese should be sensitive to this
distinction . Tha following examples with scrambled Indefinite
objects confirm this expectation for German. In sentences 64(a) to
(d) ·well-behaved' Indefinite objects have been scrambled to the left
or the negation _nicht_. The result Is ungrammatical. In 65(a) to (f)
'il l-behaved' Indefinite objects have been scrambled. The result is
grammat ical. Note that In all of those cases, the Indefinite object
could appear to the r1ght of _nicht_. It would then have to undergo
negation merging, though.

In the above sentences, an Indefinite object precedes the negation
_nicht_. If the negation _nicht_ is placed somewhere between the
specifier of IP position and the VP (an assumption we made earlier) .
the object (as well as the subJect) must have been scrambled .
Scrambling o f '111 -behaved' Indefinite objects ts permitted, but
scrambling of 'well-behaved' indefinite objects Is not.
We don't know yet what makes an indefinite object 'well -behaved' or
'ill-behaved' with respect to scrambling. And we will make no
attempt et tan exphmetion. There are probebly several f8ctors
involved. Apart from the type of verb, the type of noun phrase seems

Published by ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst, 1989

39

University of Massachusetts Occasional Papers in Linguistics, Vol. 12 [1989], Art. 10

to play a role. For our present purposes, it is sufficient that we
found a relevzmt correlation. Whenever an indefinite object can
scramble at surface-structure In German, I t can scramble at logical
form In English (and the other way round). The 'tH-behaved' Indefinite
objects, then, present no real challenge to Diesing's way of
e)(plaining why bare plurals have the readings they have. VPs are
always mapped into nuclear scopes. But there may be some
scrambling first.
We are now i n the position to make some predictions about possible
readings or Indefinite objects in Eng1 1sh. Indefinite objects in
Eng11sh should always have an exlstent1al reading. In the presence or
a suitable operator a generic reading might also be available. We
expect that a generic reading wm be available in precisely those
cases where surface-structure scrambling is possible i n German. The
following examples confirm this expectation.

The (a) sentences above are German sentences with an Indefinite
object following a sentential adverb like _metstens_ or _1mmer_.
These objects are not scrambled and can only have an existential
interpretation. The (b) sentences are like the (a) sentences, except
that the Indefinite object has been scrambled out of Its VP and
precedes the adverb (the subject must have been scrambled as well,
but this is not relevant here). The result Is grammatical for some
indeffnite objects, but not for others. If the (b) sentences are

also have a generic reading. What is important is that the Eng l ish (c)

s entenc e s have a generic read i ng in precisely those cases where

the

c orresponding German (b) sentences are grammatical. And this shows

again that the English ind e ftnite objects can be scrambl e d at logi cal
form In precisely the cases where the German indefinite objects can
be scrambled at surface-structure. Indefinite objects that cannot
scramble must stay In their VPs. They are then mapped Into nuclear
scopes and are caught by existential closure.

# 7. Where does the Davidsontan argument go?

In the preceding sections, we investigated how surface-structure
subjects and obje c ts are mapped Into logi cal representations. This
section will present some thoughts about the logical form
representation of Davidsonian arguments.
We assumed above that Oavidsonlan arguments are Implicit
arguments In languages l i ke Engl i sh or German. Otestng·s proposal,
then, does no affect it. At surface structure, Davidsonian arguments
don't appear within VP. Nor do the y appear outside of VP. In fact,
they don't appear anywhere. They will be present at the level of
logical form, though. For them to be pre sent there, they need a
predicate that takes them as an argument. St ag e- level predicates or
all k inds are one possibility. Wherever a stllge-level predicate
appears at logica l form, a variable ranging over spatlotemporal
l ocations will be present. locatives are another poss1b11ity. In h1s
comments on Davidson's paper , E.J. lemmon (196 7) proposes to
treat tense predicates like 'is before now', 'is now' , 'is after now'
as expressing properties of spatiotemporal locations (space-time
zones). Tense predicates, then, are yet another tool for introducing a
DDvldsonian argument Into a logical representation. Tense Is realized
by the inflectional element l(NFl) at surface-structure. Hence tense

https://scholarworks.umass.edu/umop/vol12/iss1/10

42

Kratzer: Stage-Level and Individual-Level Predicates

predicates are realized outside of VP, and have to appear in the
restrictive clause at logical form.

(72)

Let us look at an example.

Firemen were available

(72) is (72') (this Is a slight revision o f
the analysts o f a similar example i n section 4).

A possible logical form of

(72')

18dore now()) I & 3 x l f i n m an(x) & availabJe(x,l) I

_Past_ i s the tense predicate of

(72') . It introduces an occurrence of

the variable _1 _ into the restrictive clause. Being introduced in the
restrictive clause, the variable "I'' cannot be bound by existential
closure

•

If there Is no other quantHier to bind It, the context of use

has to supply a value. This consequence Is welcome. In an
Influential paper, Partee (1965) argues that sentences like

(72)

do

not mean that there was some time i n the past when firemen were
available. We are talking about a particular occasion here, and this i s
just what our proposal implies. Note that something has to preYent
the second occurrence of the Ytlrltable _1_ in

(72') from being ctaught

by existential closure. It seems reasonable to stipulate that
whenever one occurrence of a variable is suppl ied with a value by the
context of use, then all other occurrences of the same variable are
suppl ted with the same value. They are then _context bound_ and
cannot be caught by existential closure.

Consider the following example.

(73) has two possible I nterpretations. On the f i rst Interpretation, we

are treating _be French_ as a stage-level predicate. Imagine that

Henry used to be French , but he is now an American citi zen. The past
tense i s an effective tool for turning i ndivi dual-level predicates into

Published by ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst, 1989

43

University of Massachusetts Occasional Papers in Linguistics, Vol. 12 [1989], Art. 10
stage-level predicates. In this case, the tense predicate is a
predicate for aJ DaJvldsonian argument as expected. On the second
Interpretation, _be French_ stays an lndtvtdual-Jevel predicate. The
tense predicate now applies to the unique argument o r _be French_.
(73') gives a suitable logical rorm.

(73')

(before now (Henry3) I & l French (he3) I

In (73'), the property or being before now is not predicated of a
spatiotemporal location, but of the individual denoted by the subject.
(73') says that the individual Henry is located In the past and has the
property or being French. We may conjecture that the tense predicate
always rellltes to the external aJrgument or the main predicaJte. This
gives us an Interesting prediction. Take my aunt Theresa, for
example. She Is an almost perfect clone or my grandmother. Vet
unllke my poor grandmother, aunll_heresa Is still alive. In !tlia
situation, 74(b) and (c) are true. 74(a) and (d), however, are either
false or are cases of presupposition failure. (There is a close
connection between restrictive clauses and presuppositions , a topic
that we cannot go into here .)

_

Aunt Theresa resembled my grandmother
My grandmother resembled aunt Theresa
Aunt Theresa resembles my grandmother
My grandmother resembles aunt Theresa

These facts are easily eMplained i f the tense predicate or the above
sentences applies to the external argument of the mttin predicttte.
Note also thllt the data displayed under (74) seem to argue against
those neo-Davldsonlan approaches that assume the presence or state
arguments for verbs like _resemble_. The tense predicate In the
sentences above would then apply to a state argument and the
asymmetry observed In (74) would be unaccounted for. 74(a) and
74(b) would both be claimed to mean that there was a conteKtually

Other rel atio nsh ip s between the tense predicate and the external

The most l i kely reading of

All x I applicant (x,l) & before now(l) I I French(x) I

In (75'), the tense predicate relates to the Davidsonhm argu ment of
the predicate _appltcant_. (75') says that everybody who applted at a
particular occasion tn the past has the fndtvtdual-level property of
being French.
If the tense predicate always relates to the external argument of the
main predicate of the sentence, it follows that a variable ranging
over spatiotemporal locations must appear in the res trictive clause
of every tensed sentence whose mafn predicate is stage-level. This
ftact ts importtant for our discussion of _when_-cltauses throughout
this paper. Take the fo11owing example from sectton 2.
(76)

A possible logical representation of (76) is

(76') i s well-formed, since the quant i fier _always_ binds

the variable
_1 _ in bot h Us restrictive citause tand fts nucletar scope. The tense of
(76) is what we may call _generic tense_. One way of thinking about
generic tense Is that it Introduces predicates of the most general
kind. In (76') the tense predicate expresses no th f ng but the sortal

predlcl!te in (7 6), the vaSrt!lblewl" would only appear in the nuclear
scope. I t would then be bound by existential closure, and the whole
structure would be ruled out as a violation of the prohibition against
vacuous quantification.
The preceding sections gave a rough idea of some basic principles
guiding the mapping from surface-structures to logical forms. The

absurd. And i t is not what

(76) means. We are not assuming that we

are only talking about houses with exactly one barn. Vet our approach
seems to commit us to some such assumption. Let us briefly review
why. _A bam_ Is an object that cannot be scrambled, hence Is caught
by existential closure.The phrase _a second one_ is best analyzed as
•

<a

oarn different from i t " . The Implicit pronoun _n_ here (as well as

the explicit occurrence of _it_ In _next to it_) is anaphori cally
related to _a barn_ In the antecedent of the condi tional. Since _u_
cannot be bound by the same quantifier, it has to be analyzed as an
E-type pronoun. Following Evans and Cooper, E-type pronouns are
treated as definite descriptions. Definite descrtptlons carry
uniqueness presuppositions. In our case, the uniqueness
presupposition i s Incorporated into the restrictive clause of _often_
through presupposition accommodation.
Sentence· (76) throws us Into a reat dilemma. It is sentences 1 ike (76)
that motivated Helm (1962) to pursue what we may now call "the

classical Lewis-Kamp-Heim analysts•.

But giving (76) the analysis (78") will immediately bring back the
proportion problem. Here It is. Suppose we have

e

totrat of thirty

houses. Ten of those houses have f1ve barns each, nicety placed next
to each other. The remaining twenty houses have only one barn.
Analysts (76") predicts sentence (76) to be true In such a situation.
But it fs false.
It seems, then, that there is no way out. We seem to be either stuck
with the proportion problem or else be committed to absurd
uniqueness assumptions.
Let us not give up that fast.The approach taken in thfs paper tells us
that we should opt for representations ltke (76') under any
circumstances. These representations are Independently motivated

and avoid the proportion problem. We must then rind a way of getting
rid of unwelcome uniqueness assumptions.
We have been following Evans and Cooper In treating E-type pronouns
as definite descriptions. Evans and Cooper both adopted Russell's
treatment of definite descriptions. And so did we. Out of habit. I
think that we should continue to treat E-type pronouns as definite
descriptions. But we should adopt Heim's theory of definite
descriptions (Helm 1962). The consequences of such a move are
far-re8chlng 8nd cannot be properly explored here. Vet we may pursue
the proposal up to a point where we can see Its promise. On Helm's
approach , definite and Indefinite noun phrases are treated very much
alike. They Doth I ntroduce a predicate and a variable 1nto logical
representations. Al1 by themselves, they are netther quanttflcatlonal
nor referring. The variable Introduced has to be a new variable for
indefinite NPs and an old vari able for definite NPs. And there Is a
difference In presuppositions. Definite NPs presuppose thefr
descriptive content, but 1ndef1ntte NPs don't. Let us look 2it two
simple examples

The (a) dialogues both contain an E-type pronoun _n_. In the (b)
dial ogues, the E-type pronoun ts replaced by a suttable deftntte
description as proposed by Evans and Cooper (assume we know how
to get a suitable description). Using Helm's analysis of definite
descriptions , we arrive at the following logical representations for

(79) and (BO).

The second part of (79'} consists of a restrictive clause and a
nuclear scope conjoined by _ &_. As a result of presupposition
accommodation, the restrictive clause contains the descriptive
content of the definite description _the sheep Harry vacciMted_.
The variable _y_ occurs free tn the restrictive clause and t n the
nuclear scope of the second-part of (79'). It has to receive a value by
the context of use. A suitable value Is not difficult to find. The first
part of (79') conversationally Implicates that Harry vaccinated
exactly one sheep at the time under consideration (see Kadmon 1987
for a very detailed discussion of this point). The unique sheep Harry
vaccinated, then, wlt1 be the value for _y_. If a free variable receives
a referent from the context of use, the referent has to be familiar. in
that context. Definiteness In English Indicates famtl larlty.
Indefiniteness Indicates lack of familiarity. It follows that
variables Introduced by definite noun phrases can, but varlablas
Introduced by Indefinite noun phrases can not receive a value from
the context of use. (Thi s is important. _Fi remen are altrulsttc_
can not mean that some contextually specHied firemen are
altruistic.)
The second part of (BO') fs a tripartite quantifier construction. As
before, the restrictive clause contains the descriptive content of the
definite description . This time, the adverbial quantifier _usually_
binds all variables that occur free In the sentence, and no recourse to
contextually supplied values Is necessary. A scalar lmpltcature and

world knowledge sugg e st that 11 ary w e ars ex ac tl y one dress at each

Combining Evans and Cooper's analysis of E-tupe pronouns with
Helm's the ory of definite descriptions , then, seems to yield the
appropriate ana lys i s for sentences like (79) or (80).
Let us now r et urn to example (78). After some simpli fications
(el i mi na ti ng stacked nuclear scopes, f or exampl e), i ts f i nal logic al
form will be (78"') .

(78"') correctly captures the meaning of (78). The important part is
_ bam(y) & have (x,y)_ in the nuclear scope. This part constitutes the
descriptive content of the definite des cripti on re pl acing the two
occurrences of E-type pronouns. 51nce the variable _y_ Is not
bound from ou tside the nuclear scope, 1 t Is caught by existential
closure. Th e lo gi c a l representation (78"') correspond s to the
_Indefinite Lazy Reading_ of donkey pronouns In the terminology of
Schubert and Pelletier (forthcoming). On our approach, such a reading
ca n only arise under very special conditions. The donkey pronoun has
to be an E-type pronoun and the variable it Introduces must be caught
by existential cl o sure .
Helm's the or y of definite descriptions, then, 1s a very promising
candfdate for solving traditional problems with uniqueness In donkey
sentences. We are now free to dedicate t he remai ni ng pages to
proportions. Our approach makes a number of very concrete
predictions here, which should not go unmentioned.

and the topic-focus org11nizlltion of the sentence will llll Influence
the outcome. Yet the t11sk Is not 11n Impossible one. We know the
main factors Infl uencing judgements here and will try to keep them
under control.
In this section, we examine a special brand of donkey sentences. They
are all conditionals with antecedents restricting an adverb of
quantification. And the main predicates of the antecedents are
always transitive individual-level predicates with Indefinite
subjects 11nd objects. Following Kadmon

(1967), let us distinguish

three possible interpretations for such sentences. The three
lnterpretattons correspond to the following three types of logical
forms.

restrictive clause. Our previous discussion has shown that the
restrictive clause itself I s split into a n embedded restrictive clause
and a nuclear scope. On the symmetric reading, subject and object are
part or the embedded restrictive clause. On the subject asymmetric
reading. the subject Is part of the embedded restrictive clause, and
the object is part of the embedded nuclear scope. On the object
asymmetric reading, it i s the other way round. Note that these three
poss ibilities are the only poss18iti ties, given just one object. The
fourth concelvtable possibility (64) is e)(cluded by the prohibition
against vacuous quantification (recall that we are only considering
Individual-level predicates).

Given our assumptions about how surface-structures are mapped into
logical forms, w e are committed to a number of predictions
concerning the possible i nterpretations of English donkey sentences

of the sort considered here. If the main predicate in the antecedent Is

not unaccustative, its subject i s btase-genertated outside of VP tand htas

to be mapped Into the embedded restrictive clliUse at logical form
(recall again that we are only talking about tndlvtdual-level

predicates here). Ir the obJect Is not scrambled, we get the subJect
asymmetric interpretation. If the object Is scrambled, we have the
symmetric Interpretation. If the predicate i s unaccusative, its
subject appears outside of VP at surface structure. But it binds a
trace within VP, hence it can optionally appear in the embedded
restrictive clause or in the embedded nucletar scope at logical form.
If t t appears In the restrictive chmse and the object is not

scrambled, we arrive at the subject asymmetric Interpretation. If the
object Is scrambled, we have the symmetric Interpre tation. If the

subject appears i n the nuclear scope, the object has to be scrambl e d ,
which gives us the object asymmetric Interpretation. Here is a
summary of all the predictions

These predictions are predictions about the possibllftles permitted
by grammar. If we want to test them, we have to be aware that for
each Interpretation, there are Intonational properties favoring that
particular Interpretation (see Kadmon 1987, Helm 1987 for
discussion). That Is, if grammar allows several Interpretations for a
given sentence, intonation may bias us towards one of them. Quite
generally, deaccenting is tied to restrictive clauses, and accenting fs
tied to nuclear scopes. Here i s an overview.

For each Interpretation, there are also specific anaphora condi tions
that favor that particular Interpretation (see B8uerle & Eg11 1965,

·

Kadmon 1967, Helm 1967 for the relevant observations). That is, for
each interpretation, there is a particular configuration of donkey
pronouns that facnttates that Interpretation. (A _donkey pronoun_ i s
any pronoun i n the consequent of a conditional that is anaphorically
reltlted to an indefinite noun phrtlse in the tlntecedent.) For our
present purposes, i t i s not important to know why certain donkey

pronoun configurations faci litate certain Interpretations. likewise,
we don't have to know why certain Intonation conditions blas us
towards certain readings. At this point, we only have to know that
there are additional factors Influencing Interpretations. This will
help us to design appropriate proportion experiments. The following
table summarizes the crucial facts about donkey pronoun
configurations.

We are now in the position to test a few selected predictions. Out of
the three possible Interpretations, the object asymmetr1c
Interpretation Is predicted to be the most constrained. We should
only find it with unaccusative predicates. How can we tell that a
predicate doesn't permit an i nterpretation? I think a relatively safe
method is to create the most favorable conditions for the reading we
are after. If the reading doesn't emerge under those optimal
conditions, we may conclude that it is not available.
let us first examine the verb _adore_. _Adore_ Is individual-level, it
Is not unaccusattve, and Its object can be scrambled. All of those
properties can be established with the help of the tests discussed
earlier in tha paper. We expect, then, that the symmetr1c and the
subject-asymmetric Interpretation should be possible for a donkey
sentence Involving this verb In the antecedent, but the object
asymmetric interpretation should be excluded. let us check this last
prediction. Consider the following sentence .

1 think that sentence

(92) is intuitively false , given pur scenario.

The only Interpretation that predicts it to be false is the symmetric
interpretation. We have eighty li nguist-organization pairs such that
the linguist is a member of the organization. But we only have
twenty ltngutst-organization pairs such that the linguist identifies
with the politics of the organization. The subject asymmetric
Interpretation predicts the sentence to be true, since each linguist Is
a member of an organization she Identifies with. The object
asymmetric Interpretation predicts the sentence to be true as well,
since for most organizations, there Is a member who cares about Hs
politics.
We have seen that a verb Hke _belong_ can have an object asymmetric
.
and a symmetric Interpretation. The next example shows that, as
expected, it can also have a subject asymmetric Interpretation. As
before, Intonation and anaphora condt ttons are chosen to fit.

(94)

When a linguist belongs to a professional ORGANIZATION,
she is usually not affiliated with a university

Imagine that we have forty linguists. Twenty of them are the
linguists from the previous example, so we know about their
involvement In professional organizations. None of them Ia aff111ated
with a university. The remaining twenty linguists are members of the
Linguistic Society of America, and belong to no other professional
organization. They are all affiliated with some university. In this
situation, (94) Is Intuitively false, and the subject asymmetric
interpretation is the only interpretation that predicts it to
be f else.
An unaccusattve verb like _belong to_, then, can indeed give rise to
three Interpretations, whereas the readings for a verb 11ke _adore _
are more constrained. Whtle we dldn·t check all possible pred1cl1ons,
of course, the results obtained so far are encouraging and lend further
support to our conception of the Hnk between surfece-structure end
logicel form representellons.

All four representations 95'(a) to (d) Involve quantification over
spatlotemporal locations. While quantification over spatiotemporal
locations i s a topic that we cannot seriously pursue here,awe should
at least add a few remarks as to I t s main properties. 5pattotemporal
locations are related to each other by part-whole relationships, and
this means that we must be careful with quantification. Quite
generally, <!lny sort of quantffic<!ltion seems to require that the
domain of quantification I s set up In such a way that Its elements <!Ire
truly distinct. Take the objects i n this room. There are two tables,

two chairs, and a bed. There ere at least five objects, then. Each of
those pieces of furniture has four legs. Can we conclude that there
are at least 25 objects In this room? No way. This Is not how
counting works.
Let us now return to the condi tionals 95'(a) to (d). How do we

manage to quantify over spatiotemporal locations here? Well, we
have to ma k £ sure that the main restrictive clauses of those
conditionals specify appropriate domains. One way of guaranteeing
this quite generally is through the Interpretation mechanism for
sentences with a free Davidsonian variable. We expect the Impact of
different akttonsarten here, an issue we will have to delegate to
another occasion. As an illustration take (97), which contains the
achievement verb _spot_.

spot (Megan, Bubo, 1)

We are looking for an Interpretation of (97) that makes sure that the
set of spatiotemporal tocattons s8tisfying (97) constitutes an
appropriate domain of quantification. A requirement of this kind is

relationships holding among its members. There are two part-whole
relationships to watch out for tn our case. The rtrst one Is spatial In
nature. Whenever Megan spots Bubo on Muthatland Dr1ve, she also
spots Bubo In los'" Angeles. The second one Is temporal. If Megan
spotted Bubo yesterday, she also spotted Bubo In t 988. If the set of
entitles satisfying (97) has to consist of dtsttnct members, then we
should say that (97) Is satisfied by any spatt otemporal location 1
such thet l is e mtnlmel l ocatton where e spotting of Bubo by Megan
takes place.
A representation like 95'(a) will now be true If and only If most
mtnlmal spatlotemporal locations 1 such that a spotting or an owl by
a birder takes place In I are locations where it is night. These are the
correct truth-conditions for 95'(a) (see Berman 1967 for a parallel
proposal withtn situation semantics).
We are now in the position to return to our main toptc, donkey
sentences end proportions. We have argued thet gremmer ellows four
possible representations for (95). What I wzmt to show next ts that

these four represen tat i on s all mean the same, given some plausible
assumptions. Compare 95'(a) and (c), for example, which are repeated
here.

In 95'(c), quant1fication is over triples. The set of triples satisfying
the main restrictive caause of 95'(c) has very special properties,
however. Whenever two triples < 1 , a, b> and <1, c, d> are In the set,
then a = c and b = d. Why is this? The main restrictive clause of
95'(c) ts sattsfted by any triple < 1 ,a, b> such that 8 Is 8 birder and b
I s an owl and 1 Is a minimal spattotempor8l loce!!t lon where 8 spots b.
If 1 ts to be a mtntmal spattotempor8l location where 8 spots b, then
a and b have to be at 1, but there couldn't be other birders or owls at
1. If there were, the location wouldn't be minimal any more. It Is now
easy to establtsh that there is a one to one correspondence between
the locations satisfying the main restrictive clause of 95'(a) and. the
triples satisfying the main restrictive clause of 95'(c). Whenever a
location I satisfies the main restrictive cl e!! use of 95'(a), then there
i s i!l unique pi!! i r <a,b>, such that <l,a,b> satifles the restrictive
clause of 95'(c). And whenever a trtpel <l,a,b> satisfies the matn
restriattve clause of 95'(c), then 1 satlsftes the matn restrictive
clause of 95'(a). It can now be shown that a location satisfies the
main restrictive clause and the main nuclear scope of 95'(a) If and
only i f the corresponding triple satisfies the main restrictive clause
and the main nuclear scope of 95'(c). But this means that 95'(a) Is
true If and only if 95'(c) is. Similar arguments can be made to show
that all four representations 95'(i!!) to (c) C!lre assigned the same
meaning. But then we shouldn't get any 'true' proportion effects with
sentences like (95) at all. The tnterpretatton of those sentences

should always amount to something that looks like the symmetric
interpretation we discussed for individual-level predicates. It isn't,
or course. We only get a slmtlar er rect by quanttrytng over
l ocations.
The d i scussion in Bouerle & Egli (198S) suggests that this last
e><pectation mtght not be qufte right. Suppose we have a hundred
birders. They go bird watching on Muthatland drive. One half of the
bird watchers goes in groups of ten. The other fifty birders go o n
indivtdual outings . Each party hkes off on a different day and spots
exactly one owl. The five groups of ten spot their owl during the
day. The fHty Individual bird watchers spot their owl at night. on
this scenario, (95) ts Intuitively true. Yet it seems that our analysts
predicts i t to be false. There are fifty minimal spattotemporal
locations 1 such that a birder spots an owl at 1 and I is a day ttme
location. And there i s not more than an equal number of minimal
spattotemporal locations 1 such that a birder spots an owl at 1 and I

is. a night location Using_e_xamples"ofathis-kind, Berman (t 987)'

argues that there t s a certain leeway as to what a minimal locatfon
(situation I n hts framework) Is. I n our case, he would reason that I f a
birder I s part of a group, the mlntmal location I n which she spots an
owl mtght sometimes be taken to be identical with the minimal
location in which the whole group spots the owl. This is what i t
means t o spot a n o w l together. likewise, should a birder spot
several owls a t the same time, we would sometimes want to
treat those owls as a group. The minimal spatiotemporal locatton
where the birder spots one owl would then be Identical with the
mtntmal spatl otemporal location where he spots the whole
group .
With stage-l evel predicates in the antecedent, then, we may get group
effects i n donkey sentences. These group effects have been mistaken
for _true_ asymmetric readings, And 'true' asymmetric readings have
been misinterpreted as group effects

•

Within a Davldsonian

framework, the latter proposal would require that Individual-level
predicates have a Davtdsonian argument (an eventuality argument),

https://scholarworks.umass.edu/umop/vol12/iss1/10

too. While this approach I s attractive and i s found i n the donkey
sentence l l terature , the evidence accumulated in this paper argues
against such a move.
For the sake or argument, suppose that , contrary to what we have
argued before, Individual-level predicates have a Davidsontan
argument after all. Would it then be plausible to analyze all
asymmetric readings as group effects as proposed by Berman?

1 think not. A major difficulty for such a proposal would be to
account for missing asymmetric reGdlngs with lndividuGl-level
predtcates, for example. Recall the case or the Stcl1fans adoring
Bellini operas. There I s no conceptual reason that could prevent us
from regarding the fans of a particUlar piece of music as a group.
Otherwise, we couldn't have sentences like

(98)

(98).

They adore the same piece or music

Properties like 'adoring the same piece of music' cam only apply to
plural Individuals or groups. But then It should be conceptually
possible to consider all the Sicilians who adore a piece of music as a
group. And we should get the effect of an object asymmetr1c reading
for sentence

(99)

(99) (repeated from above).

When a SICILIAN adores a piece or music, It Is rarely a Be11ini
opera

We have seen that an object asymmetric reading is not possible far

(99).

And we have given a syntactic explanation for th1s fact. The

preceding thoughts suggest that the syntactic explanation given
cannot be reduced t o a simple 'conceptuel' one. If this line of
reasoning Is ·on the right track, then there are two sources for what
looks itke asymmetric readings i n donkey sentences. The source I s
syntactic with tndfvtdua1-1evel predicates, and 'conceptueJ' wfth
stage-level predicates. This means that Kadmon's account of
asymmetric readings seems to be correct for individual-level

predicates. And the proposal or Berman (1967) i s likely to turn out
to be the l!dequate account for stage-level predicates.

(d) ComQarlsons and concluding remarks
Several recent di scussions of donkey sentences have considered the
possibility of going back to a position where all indefinites are
uniformly treated as existential quantifiers (Helm 1967, Groenendijk
& Stokhor 1967, Chi erchia 1966, Schubert & Pelletier (forthcoming)).
All of those proposals were intended to overcome some apparent
shortcom1ngs of the ortg1nal Lewts-Kamp-He1m proposal. Major
concerns Include the proportion problem and a commitment to
implausible readings for sentences like the following (almost
Schubert & Pe 11 e tf er's sentence)
(t OO)

If I find a qaart_er in my pocket, I'll put it in the parking
meter

Schubert & Pelletier argue that on i t s most plausible reading, a
sentence ltke (1 00) doesn't mean that all quarters that I wt11 ftnd In
my pocket will have to go into the parking meter. This Intuition
seems right, contrary to what the classical lewis-Kamp-Heim
approach predicts.
In this concluding section, I will briefly address the major Issues
ratsed by these new proposals. And I will conclude that the sltght
amendments to the cl21sslcal Lewis-Kamp-Heim appro21ch that we
have been arguing for In this paper are to be preferred.
If all Indefinite noun phrases t n the antecedents of donkey sentences
are treated as existential quantifiers, all donkey pronouns are E-type
pronouns. They are pronouns that are anaphorically related to a
quanttftcatlonal NP that doesn't c-:command them. We considered two
possible analyses of E-type pronouns. The standard analysis takes
them to be Aussellftm definite descriptions. Our own zmalysis tre2its
them as Heimt21n definite descriptions. This means that they 21re like

tndef tnlte desc:riptions if they are caught by existential closure.
Heim 1967 criticlllly examines the first proposal for donkey
pronouns. The analysts or Chlerchta 1966 can be seen as a version of
the second proposal. Both Helm and Chlerchla rely on a
neo-Davldsonlan framework where all predicates have an eventuality
argument. Here i s a sketch of the essence of the two types of
analyses for a simple donkey sentence (let us call these analyses
_£-type only_ analyses).
(I0I)

When a donkey Is stubborn, I t is usulllly from Andorra
E:lYD..e... DronounsasdefinitedescrloUoos
For most minimal eventualities e such that there ts a
stubborn donkey in e there ts an eventualtty e' such that the
unique donkey that Is stubborn In e is from Andorra In e'.

aYI!LDronoynsosIndefinitedescdottons

For most minimal eventualities e such that there Is a
stubborn donkey tn e there ts an eventuality e' such that a
donkey that ts stubborn tn e Is from Andorra tn e'.

Assuming that quantification in (I 0 I) Is over minimal eventual Hies
where a donkey is stubborn (as It has to be, given the arguments
above), the two analyses yield the same truth-con.dittons for (I 0 1).
Every mtntmal eventuality where a donkey i!. stubborn i s an
eventaoiHy where exactly one donkey is stubborn. There are other
sentences, however, where the two types of analyses make difrerent
predictions. The following type or example Is an Individual-level
version of a paraJJel stage-level e>eample ascribed to Hans Kamp
(_when a bishop meets another man, he blesses him_, Hats Roath,
personal communication).

Nett her 'E-type only' analysis gets the truth-conditions for

right. Given that 'resemble' Is a symmetric relation, the first

ZJnalysts mllkes (1 02) trwa in an worlds I n which no man resembles
another man and false In all other worlds. There stmply cannot be a

unique man who resembles another man. The second analysts doesn't
capture the fact that (I 02) says that whenever two men resemble
each other they both try to avoid the other. lt only requires that one
of the two men tries to avoid the other.

Examples like (102) provide one of the strongest arguments in favor

of a Lewts-Kamp-Heim analysts. Since our proposal preserves the

essential features of this analysis, it Is able to treat those examples
correctly. Depending on whether the object _another man_ In the
antecedent of

(1 02)

Is scrambled or not, our approach admt ts the

following two logical representations .

Both representations predict that whenever two men resemble each
other they both try to avoid the other.
Example (I 02) shows that 'E-type only' analyses or donkey sentences
face serious emptrtcal problems that our verst on of the
lewts-Kamp-Heim analysts avoids . let us now turn to some of ahe
problems with the classical Lewls-Kamp-Heim approach that 'E-type
only' analyses are designed to overcome. We have already discussed
the proportion problem. One important point to keep tn mind is that
the task here ts not just to overcome a problem. An adequate
analysts has to be a bl e to actually predict the subtle proportton

fDcts we encountered above. An- approach that treats all Indefinite

noun phrases un\formly as existential quantlfieas and a11 donkey

pronouns untformty as E-type pronouns Is unlikely to achieve this.

Let us finally examtne sentence (I 00), whtch Is repeated here

cannot be replaced by _when_. We have argued above that in this case,
the _jf _-clause restricts an epistemic modal. We have also seen that
epistemic modals cannot bind variables. Our approach now permits

the following logical form for (100).

(put (1, x, parking meter, t•) I I
In (100'), the variable _ 1 _ i s left free , since _must_ cannot bind it. It
w i l l have to receive a vzslue from the context or use, hence has a

definite interpretation. The Indefinite noun phrase _a quarter_ h8S to
be mapped Into the embedded nuclear scope of the main restrictive
clause, where the variable it introduces can be caught by e)(lstenttal
closure. If it were mapped into the embedded restrictive clause of
the matn restrictive clause, the vartable could not be bound. Nor
could it receive a value from the context of use (due to the
i ndeftnl teness of _8 quarter_). The donkey pronoun _u _ must be
interpreted as- an E-type pronoun (_the quarter i n maf pocket_). It is
analyzed as a Helmtan description, and the variable It Introduces Is
caught by existential closure. The result Is precisely the reading

Schubert & Pelletier want to get for (I 00). If I find a quarter tn my
pocket, I will put a quarter from among the quarters 1 find In my
pocket tn the parking meter. The other examples that Schubert &

Pelletier use to show that a Lewis-Kamp-Helm analysis i s •plain
wrong• can be treated in the same way.
It seems, then, that the s11ght amendments to the classical
Lewls-Kamp-Helm approach that we have been advocating In this
paper not only overcome the problems of the original proposal, but
also avoid the empirical shortcomings of the 'E -type only' theori es
that were Intended t o be its successors.
