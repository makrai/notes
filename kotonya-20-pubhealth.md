# Abstract

* Fact-checking of matters for which expertise is required
* we: the first study of explainable fact-checking for such claims
* For our case study we choose the setting of public health
* we construct a new dataset PUBHEALTH of
  11.8K claims accompanied by journalist crafted, gold standard explanations
  (ie judgments) to support the fact-check labels for claims
* We explore two tasks: veracity prediction and explanation generation
* coherence of explanation, three properties
  * We also define and evaluate, with humans and computationally, three
    coherence properties of explanation quality
* results indicate that, by training on in-domain data, gains can be made in
  explainable, automated fact-checking for claims which require specific expert
