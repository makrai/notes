# Abstract

* This article evaluates three proposed laws of semantic change. Our claim is
  * the proposed negative correlation between meaning change and word frequency
    is shown to be largely an artefact of the models of word representation
    used;
  * the proposed negative correlation between meaning change and
    prototypicality is shown to be much weaker than what has been claimed in
    prior art; and
  * the proposed positive correlation between meaning change and polysemy is
    largely an artefact of word frequency.
* analytical proofs that show that count representations introduce an inherent
  dependence on word frequency, and thus word frequency cannot be evaluated as
  an independent factor with these representations.
