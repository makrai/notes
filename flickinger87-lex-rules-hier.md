#Preface

* hierarchy of word classes that I present in the first part of this thesis

#1 Introduction 1

* status of the lexicon as an appropriate repository of generalizations about
  language has changed dramatically in the last ten years of work in
  generative grammar.  Today enjoying a position of central importance in
  theoretical linguistics, the lexicon provides
  * the basis for expressing generalizations about phenomena which include
    * infection and derivation, but also
    * constructions
      * once viewed as outside the scope of the lexicon, such as the
      * passive relation and properties of control
* two basic questions:
  (1) What mechanisms are necessary for expressing these lexical
  generalizations precisely enough to make them falsifiable?
  (2) What aspects of constituent structure within a sentence remain not
  accounted for once these lexical mechanisms are in place?
* Work of the last ten years by
  * Selkirk, Lieber, Anderson, Williams, Kiparsky, and others contains
    * some concrete proposals for lexical representation and word structure as
      they affect inflection and derivation, but each of these
    * assumes a rich, transformational syntactic component about which few
      details are provided
  * linguists following Bresnan, Wasow, and Dowty
    * syntactic or semantic generalizations
    * without recourse to transformations
    * the structure of the lexicon and its connections to phrase structure are
      only partially specified
* In this work I present a detailed view of the structure of the lexicon and
  * two mechanisms for expressing regularities within the lexicon, then show
  * interact with, but do not obviate, the phrase structure rules

#2 Structure of the Word Class Hierarchy 5

* two ways in which lexical entries can be related, giving rise to two formal
  mechanisms for representing this sharing of properties
  1. category-based
    * items share some syntactic properties
    * a given lexical item will often belong to several word classes, with each
      class contributing part of the definition of that lexical entry
  2. morphological basis
    * entries of different categories have a common morphological base
      (ignoring suppletion), and often exhibit similar idiosyncratic
      properties

##2.1 Lexical entries

2.1.1 Fully-specified lexical entries 11

##2.2 Word class hierarchy

2.2.1 _In the beginning was the Word_

##2.3 Complementation hierarchy

2.3.1 Subclasses of COMPLEMENTATION
2.3.2 Subclasses of INCOMPLETE 25

##2.4 Part-of-speech hierarchy

2.4.1 Subclasses of PART-OF-SPEECH
2.4.2 Subclasses of VERB
2.4.3 Verb Types
2.4.4 Verb Forms
2.4.5 Subclasses of NOUN
2.4.6 Noun types
2.4.7 Noun Number classes
2.4.8 The ADJECTIVE class 50
2.4.9 The PREPOSITION class
2.4.10 Subclasses of MINOR

#3 Inheritance and Subcategorization

* default properties and idiosyncracies
* how lexical items subcategorize for both complements and adjuncts


##3.1 Inheritance

3.1.1 An illustration of inheritance
3.1.2 Overriding of default values

##3.2 Subcategorization

3.2.1 A constraint on subcategorization
3.2.2 Optional complements vs. adjuncts
3.2.3 Selection by heads for adjuncts

#4 Phrase structure rules

* in HPSG frame-work
* attributes and values used to define lexical entries interact with a small
  set of grammar rules and universal feature principles to provide the
  syntactic structures,


##4.1 Rules and feature conventions

4.1.1 Three conventions
4.1.2 Some phrase structure rules
4.1.3 Linear order constraints
4.1.4 Exceptions to default linear order

##4.2 Two examples


##4.3 Trace introduction


#5 Lexical Rules 101

* a second kind of generalization which holds between the elements of two
  related classes, and introduce the familiar notion of the lexical rule


##5.1 On the Content and Form of Lexical Rules

5.1.1 Lexical rule for passive
5.1.2 Passives and idiosyncratic case in Icelandic
5.1.3 Lexical rule for To-datives

##5.2 Exceptional Properties

5.2.1 Linking of lexical rules and word classes
5.2.2 Exceptions

##5.3 The function of lexical rules

5.3.1 Lexical rules and word classes
5.3.2 Lexical rules and phrase structure rules

#6 Adjectives and Unbounded Dependencies

* Adjectival passives
* _tough-movement_ adjectives
* _too/enough_ constructions The chapter concludes with an account of
* one class of unbounded dependencies,


##6.1 Adjectival passives


##6.2 _Tough-Movement_ adjectives

6.2.1 Two kinds of amusing
6.2.2 Nouns of the easy class
6.2.3 On hard problems to solve

##6.3 _Too_ and _enough_

6.3.1 Not lexical rules
6.3.2 Phrasal analysis of _too/enough_ constructions
6.3.3 More than _enough_

##6.4 Sonatas and double gaps


##6.5 Tensed-VP constructions

6.5.1 Parasitic gaps

#7 Summary

* summarize the mechanisms introduced in the course of the presentation, and
  the constraints both implicit and explicit that I proposed to govern the
  applicability of these tools
1. distinguishing the work of lexical rules from that of word classes and
   inheritance
2. maintaining a sharp distinction between lexical rules and phrase structure
   rules
