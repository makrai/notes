# Abstract

* We propose an automatic standardization for the construction of cross-lingual
  similarity datasets, and provide an evaluation, demonstrating its reliability
  and robustness. Based on our procedure and taking the 
* RG-65 word similarity dataset as a reference, we release two high-quality
  * Spanish and Farsi (Persian) monolingual datasets, and 
  * fifteen [low-quality] cross-lingual datasets for six languages: 
    * English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Farsi.
    * an improved version of the approach of Kennedy and Hirst (2012) 
      * an automatic procedure for the construction of a French-English version
        of RG-65.
