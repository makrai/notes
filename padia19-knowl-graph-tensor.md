* We present a family of novel methods for embedding knowledge graphs into
  real-valued tensors.  These tensor-based embeddings capture the ordered
  relations that are typical in the knowledge graphs represented by semantic web
  * easily use prior background knowledge provided by users or extracted
    automatically from existing knowledge graphs
  * more robust methods for knowledge graph embedding, we provide a
  * provably-convergent, linear tensor factorization algorithm. We demonstrate
  * [experiments on] the task of predicting new facts across eight different
    knowledge graphs, achieving 
    between 5% and 50% relative improvement over existing SOTA knowledge graph
    embedding techniques
* all of the tensor decomposition models perform well when the average degree of
  an entity in a graph is high, with 
  * constraint-based models doing better on graphs 
  with a small number of highly similar relations and 
  * regularization-based models dominating for graphs 
  with relations of varying degrees of similarity.
