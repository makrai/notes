# Abstract

* a novel rule-based, language independent method for determining lex entailmen
  * semantic representations built from Wiktionary definitions
  * Combined with a simple WordNet-based method
  * top scores on the English and Italian datasets of the Semeval-2020 task
    “Predicting Multilingual and Cross-lingual (graded) Lexical Entailment”
    (Glavaš et al., 2020)
* A detailed error analysis of our output uncovers future directions for
  * semantic parsing method and the inference process on semantic graphs.

## 3.2

* The main source of false positives generated by our method
  * the hypothesis word is part of a locative phrase accessible from the
    premise word via a dependency path that is mapped to a path of 0-edges in
    the 4lang-representation
  * Wiktionary nose: A protuberance on the face,
    * the dependency relation nmod(nose, face) is established, and in the
  * We deleting nodes that connect to any of a
    short language-specific list of function words such as certain prepositions
    (eg English in, of, on, German in, auf, Italian di, su, il) and words
    conveying negation (English not, German keine, etc).
