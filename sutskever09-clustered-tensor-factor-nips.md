Modelling Relational Data using Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization
NIPS 2009

#Abstract

* cluster-based models yield more easily interpretable representations, while
  factorization-based approaches have given better predictive performance on
* We introduce the Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization (BCTF) model, which
  embeds a factorized representation of relations in a nonparametric Bayesian
  clustering framework. Inference is fully Bayesian but scales well to large
  data sets. The model simultaneously discovers interpretable clusters and
  yields predictive performance that matches or beats previous probabilistic
  models for relational data.
