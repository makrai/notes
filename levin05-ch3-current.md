  * semantic roles are not unanalyzable notions. We reviewed
  * two approaches to overcoming this problem: unpackaging the content of
    * bundles of binary features and
    * arguments to be assigned more than one semantic role
* In this chapter, we survey two other widely adopted solutions. The first
  * Van Valin (1999); “generalized semantic roles.” On this approach
    * the content of traditional semantic roles is unpackaged into more basic
      components, as in the feature decomposition approach, but
      these components do not constitute a set of jointly necessary and
      sufficient conditions on any given role
  * predicate decomposition
    * a more structured lexical semantic representation known as a predicate
* The current theories of argument realization build on one/other/both

    * Croft (1998) characterizes them as “super-roles.”
* subject and object are different from other morphosyntactic exps of args
  * As discussed in section 1.6, the notions of
  * both can be associated with a particularly wide range of semantic roles, and
    there are morphosyntactic processes which alter the assignment of arguments
  => difficult to associate semantic roles with these grammatical relations, and

### 3.1.1 Dowty’s (1991) proto-role approach 53

* Dowty (1991); semantic roles are viewed as cluster concepts or prototypes,
  * not imposing jointly necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in a
  * it has been widely discussed and adopted. We also briefly discuss the work
  * Schlesinger (1995): prototype approach, while highlighting points of

#### 3.1.1.1 An overview of the proto-role approach

* two prototype-based generalized semantic roles: the Agent/Pat Proto-role and
  * arguments are associated with lexical entailments (or presuppositions)
    imposed on them by their verbs, and that
    semantic roles = recurring clusters of lexical entailments imposed by groups
    of predicates on one of their arguments.
  * ie Semantic roles are secondorder properties – properties of predicates.
  * Such clusters of entailments deserve a semantic role label only to the
    extent that they enter into significant linguistic generalizations – they
  * with respect to argument selection, only two such roles need be recognized,
    an Agent Proto-role and a Patient Proto-role. He associates these two
(1) Contributing properties for the Agent Proto-Role: (Dowty 1991)
  * volitional involvement in the event or state
  * sentience (and/or perception)
  * causing an event or change of state in another participant
  * movement (relative to the position of another participant)
  * (exists independently of the event named by the verb)
(2) Contributing properties for the Patient Proto-Role:
  * undergoes change of state
  * incremental theme
  * causally affected by another participant
  * stationary relative to movement of another participant
  * (does not exist independently of the event, or not at all)
* the last, parenthesized entailment in each set has its (+/~ presupp exits)
  * origins in the lists of subject properties in Keenan (1976, 1984). Dowty
  * Dowty is unsure whether they belong to the discourse dimension of subjhood
    rather than the semantic dimension
  * Polinsky (1996) further discusses them with respect to the
    recipient and theme arguments of dative verbs
  * She associates it with the semantic characterization of certain arguments,
    * it is important to establishing a link between the semantic and discourse
      characterizations of the arguments of dative verbs.
* the components of meaning that enter into the proto-roles
  overlap significantly with those proposed in previous discussions of agent/pat
  * also figure in the more structured lexical semantic representations that are
    introduced in the next section
  * The only not-sem-role notion is “incremental theme,” an aspectual notion,
    * discussed in section 4.2.1
* The main innovation, then, is
  * not in the content of the semantic components which enter into the role defs
  * that these components contribute to the degree to which an argument is
    an agent or a patient without being jointly necessary and suffic
  * no longer any reason to provide an exhaustive analysis of all arguments in a
    given sentence in terms of recognized semantic roles. This, too, is a major
* no invariant entailment or set of entailments which determines subj/objecthood
  * eg satisfying only one of the relevant entailments of each proto-role to the
    * the subject of John sees/fears Mary only possesses the Agent Proto-role
      entailment of __sentience__ (Dowty 1991)), while the
      object of John erased the error only possesses the change-of-state Patient
      Proto-role entailment (Dowty 1991)). Thus, any given argument
  * there are pairs of subject NPs or object NPs with no shared proto-rol entail
  * prototypical – example of agt: Brutus assassinated Caesar.
  * args agt/pat-like to a degrees ~ the number of Proto-role entailments
* The existence of more and less central exemplars of a category is
  a defining characteristic of a prototype category (Rosch 1973).
* A single NP may even have both Agent and Patient Proto-role entailments. For
  * frighten psych-verbs have a change-of-state interpretation, their
    obj has sentience but undergoing a change of state (Dowty 1991).
* an argument of a verb need not be associated with any of these entailments.
  * Although presumably every argument of a verb is associated with some
    entailment or presupposition imposed by its verb,
    Dowty: no evidence that each such semantic restriction be associated with a
    recognized semantic role with generalizations concerning argument real
* The proto-role approach to semantic roles is consistent with that
  * most recognized roles have what Dowty has termed “unclear boundaries.” This
  * solves the problem of generalizations that need to be stated over semantic
    roles of different grain-size (see section 2.2.1).
  * Natural classes of arguments by making reference to shared entailments;
    depending on the number of shared entailments, broader or nar-
    rower sets of arguments are picked out.
    Although for the purposes of subject and object selection, Dowty argues that
    only the broad categories he labels the Agent and Patient Proto-roles need
    be recognized, languages have other generalizations involving argument
    realization which refer to narrower semantic categories.
* goal: subject and object selection rules that have wide coverage and that
  overcome some of the problems facing rules formulated in terms of regular
  semantic roles. Dowty
  * the argument with the most Agent/Pat Proto-role entailments is subj/obj
    (his Argument Selection Principle). Thus,
  => arguments which meet all the criteria for agenthood are always, in all
  languages, expressed as subjects in nonpassive sentences.
* three-place predicates, the non-subject argument with the more/fewer Patient
  Proto-role entailments is the direct object/oblique or prepositional object
* these rules represent
  not a step in a derivation, but rather
  constraints “on what kind of lexical predicates may exist in natural language,
  * A verb may “lexicalize” a partic pairing of sem arg typ & gramm rel,
    but these pairings must conform to the “constraints” defined by the rules.
* these rules can handle many widely discussed examples, such as
  * fear/frighten verb pairs, the
  * locative alternation, and several other less familiar instances of
  * hit and kick: verbs of surface contact and motion such as and so-called
  * hug and kiss: “partially symmetric interactive” predicates
    (Gleitman 1965; Gleitman+ 1996; Lakoff and Peters 1969). To illustrate how
* psych-verbs and partially symmetric interactive predicates.
  * discussed in section 1.2, psych-verbs fall into
  * two classes:
    * experiencer–subject fear verbs and the experiencer–object frighten verbs.
  * both types have an Agent Proto-role entailment associated with both their
    stimulus and their experi-encer arguments: the
    sentience entailment for the experiencer and the
    causation entailment for the stimulus. Since
    * no other proto-role entailments distinguish between the arguments of these
      verbs (on their stative use)
  => the subject and object selection rules do not unambiguously determine which
  argument is subject and which object
  * so the appropriate pairing is determined verb-by-verb or, possibly,
    language-by-language
  * explains why just this class of verbs allows different choices as to how
    particular verbs lexicalize the projection of their arguments
  * nonstative change-of-state reading (e.g., The loud noise frightened me), as
    well as the previously discussed stative meaning (e.g., Ghosts frighten me);
    * found with the comparable class of psych-verbs in other languages,
      an observation Dowty attributes to Croft (1986) (see also Croft [1993]).
    * when the experiencer is entailed to undergo a change of state, it is
      associated with a Patient Proto-role entailment, creating an asymmetry
    * fear verbs are consistently stative and never show this ambiguity.) As
    * Dowty; frighten verbs (on their stative use) also show a well-known range
      of peculiar syntactic properties (Giorgi 1983; Pesetsky 1987, 1995;
      Postal 1971). These properties
      * often given a syntactic explanation which builds on the assumption that
        the subject of these verbs is syntactically derived. Since
      * Dowty their object has the Agent Proto-role entailment of sentience
* partially symmetric interactive predicates (1991). Such pred-
  * two patterns of argument realization in English and many other languages:
    * subject in the form of a conjoined or a collective NP or they may have
    * both a subject and an object (or sometimes a with PP)

    * For certain predicates, like debate and play chess, yes
      (e.g., Smith and Jones debated; Smith debated Jones). For others, this

    * `#`The truck and the lamppost collided is odd,
      except where a lamppost came loose and rolled down a hill, crossing the
  * A single generalization covers the hug and collide examples:
    when the alternate argument realizations differ in entailments, there is
    always an Agent Proto-role entailment which the denotation of the object (or
    the prepositional object) can lack, but which must hold for all subject
    denotations in the conjoined NP version. Whether or not there can be a
    difference in entailments seems to depend on the kind of activity denoted by
    the verb itself, but if the meaning of the verb does not force both
    arguments in the two-argument option to have exactly the same set of
    entailments, then the argument with more Agent Protorole entailments is
    the subject and the other is a nonsubject. What is important is that the
    * not make reference to agency per se, but to the Agt entailments, which,
      when distributed differentially over the arguments, determine the subj. It
* intransitive Vs
  * Dowty is primarily interested in transitive verbs, he briefly addresses how
  * as part of a discussion of unaccusativity (1991). He suggests that
  * subject selection for one-argument intransitive verbs is trivial: every
    => Unaccusative/unerg verbs would then be distinguished without recourse to
    distinct syntactic analyses
  * unergative/unaccusative verbs have an argument with predominantly Agent/Pat
  * The morphosyntactic repercussions [unintended consequence] would be a result
    <= some of the Agent and Patient Proto-role entailments being
    grammaticalized in some languages. 3
* Baker (1997)
  takes advantage of the basic properties of proto-roles
  to handle variation in subject choice with a given verb.
  * eg inst cannot be subj, if there of there is agt
  * we discuss more extensively in section 6.2,
  * often an argument bearing a particular semantic role
    may be chosen as a subject only in the absence of an argument bearing some
    other role
  * eg
    * instrument is never the subject in the presence of an agent Fillmore (68)
    * nor is a recipient ever the subject in the presence of an agent.
  * Baker (1997); due to variability in the proto-role associated with an arg
  * In the presence of an agent, a recipient will not be analyzed as having the
    Agent Proto-role, but in the absence of an agent it can be.
    * certain participants in an event are less prone to being seen as agents
      than others are, but the one seen as an agent is always the subject”
    * such an approach would be impossible with traditional semantic roles.
* Schlesinger (1995) presents another approach to using prototype notions in the
  * a wider range of semantic relations of arguments to verbs than Dowty does,
  * only gives prototype characterizations to some of them; again, one of his
  * motivations; express argument realization generalizations concisely.
  * he introduces what he calls the A-case, which
    subsumes agents, as well as certain instruments, and certain patients
  * The subsumption of patients under the A-case
    reflects its association with subject position, and Schlesinger’s desire
    to subsume under it the subjects of the following examples, which
    * would be characterized variously as
      agents, as in (3), patients, as in (4), and instruments, as in (5).
      (Since Dowty’s concern is subject selection for transitive verbs this
      * his discussion of unaccusativity suggests that
        he still characterizes the subjects of verbs such as those in (4) as
        having Patient Proto-role entailments.)

(3) a. The little boy threw the ball.
    b. They pushed the chair to the table.
    c. The girl drank her coffee.
(Schlesinger 1995))3.1

(4) a. The butter melted in the sun.
    b. My little dog remained indoors all day long.
    c. The guard is standing near the entrance. (Schlesinger 1995))

(5) The knife cut the cake. (Schlesinger 1995))

* Arguments bearing the A-case are associated with one or more of
  cause, control, and change
  * These features are reminiscent of entailments in Dowty’s Agent Proto-role
  * hE, the relationship between Dowty’s movement and Schlesinger’s change needs
    * Dowty, movement with respect to another participant is an Agent Proto-role
      only in the absence of a cause (1991)
      otherwise, undergoing a change of state is a Patient Proto-role entailment
    * Schlesinger, in contrast, does not impose such a restriction since
      * change is included as an A-case feature in order to allow for patients
* Schlesinger does not propose a counterpart to Dowty’s Patient Proto-role; he
  * no single semantic characterization of object selection is possible, and
  * the statement of a unified object selection rule is even more difficult
    because some patients need to come under his subject selection rule, rather
    than an object selection rule.

#### 3.1.1.2 Extensions and limitations 59

* Dowty’s proto-role approach has been adopted by many researchers
  (Aissen 1999; Alsina 1996; Aranovich 2000; Asudeh 2001; Filip 1996; Joshi
  1993; Singh 1992; Zaenen 1993), including some who have
  * refined and extended it (Ackerman and Moore 1999, 2001; Blume 1998; Davis
    2001; Davis and Koenig 2000; Primus 1999)
  * to nominals (Barker and Dowty 1993).
* However, Dowty’s (1991) paper itself is rather modest in scope. It does
  * not integrate the proto-role approach into a larger theory of grammar, and
    so hardly deals with any issues relating to syntax. It provides
  * no analysis of verbs that are the output of morphosyntactic rules which
    change valence, voice, or grammatical relations.
  * mainly English data and so does not deal with argument realization in
    languages with richer morphosyntax, which raise additional questions about
    argument realization (see section 1.6). It does not even present a specific
  * no theory of lexical semantic representation, and Dowty
  * stresses that his approach is compatible with many other approaches
  * merely shows how certain aspects of meaning – which can be represented in a
    variety of ways – are input to argument selection
* We now present ways in which Dowty’s theory has been extended to widen its
  scope and discuss some of its most serious limitations – limitations which
  often reflect its very nature.
  * further discussion; Croft (1998), Davis (2001), Davis and Koenig (2000),
    Koenig and Davis (2001), Newmeyer (2002), Primus (1999), Tenny (1992, 1994),
    Van Valin (1999).
* only apply to verbs that are _known to be_ transitive; they simply determine
  which argument is the subject and which the object, as
  * also noted by Davis (2001), Davis and Koenig (2000), and Primus (1999). Yet,
  * As reviewed in section 1.5
  * crosslinguistically, verbs that fit the agent-act-on-patient mold – verbs
    whose arguments meet most, if not all, of the Agent Proto-role and Patient
    Proto-role entailments – are necessarily transitive, while
    there is substantial crosslinguistic variation in the transitivity of verbs
    that do not fit this mold. Furthermore,
* not extend his system beyond transitives to two-argument intransitives. Yet,
  * Davis (2001) and Davis and Koenig (2000) point out,
  * among two-argument intransitive verbs,
    the argument with the most Agent Proto-role entailments is realized as the
    subject and the other argument is realized as an oblique
    (e.g., The magician relies on sleight of hand [kézügyesség]) and not vice
    versa (e.g., ∗ Sleight of hand relies on/by/of/with the magician; Davis
  * the very same semantic notions which figure in Dowty’s theory of argument
    selection for transitive verbs are implicated with two-argument intransitive
* not provide an account of object selection for verbs showing the dative alter
  * Primus (1999) introduces a Recipient Proto-role to deal with such verbs
* all the entailments entering into each proto-role carry equal weight, yet, as
  * Dowty; “causation has priority over movement, since
    movement is an Agent Proto-role entailment only when it is not caused by
    another participant.
  * Schlesinger; “cause has more weight than change when these compete” (1995).
    * proposes that “assignment to the A-case is determined by three factors:
      * the relative strength of the features;
      * their number; and
      * their differential weights” (1995), while
  * Dowty; “I also would not rule out the desirability of ‘weighting’
  * Ackerman and Moore (2001), Davis (2001), and Davis and Koenig (2000)
    * primacy of the cause entailment.
* When an agentive verb is causativized
  in languages which allow productive morphological causativization,
  the new cause argument invariably becomes the subject of the derived pred,
  regardless of the number of Agent Proto-role entailments carried by the
  subject argument of the base verb.
  * eg even if the base verb requires that its subject be
    * sentient, as in _The frosty weather made her cough_ or, even
    * sentient and volitional, as in _The cold weather made her run faster_
* Koenig and Davis (2001) suggest a ranking of certain Proto-Agent entailments
  * for all verbs that denote causal events, the only proto-agent entailment
    that we need to consider is whether the participant causally affects another
    participant
  * Similarly, among non-causative verbs,
    * sentience is sufficient to ensure mapping to subject
    * Volitional involvement in the event is also sufficient to ensure mapping
      to subject position in noncausative verbs.
  * for all verbs for which being in motion counts as a proto-agent entailment,
    the NP denoting the moving object is mapped onto subject position.
* the relative importance of the Patient Protorole entailments
  * Jackendoff (1996b); the incremental theme Patient Proto-role entailment
    does not have a part to play
  * We defer a full discussion of this notion until the larger discussion of
    aspectual determinants of argument realization in section 4.2.
* relative priority of various semantic features in subject and object selection
  * Tsunoda (1985) criticizes
    Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) prototype approach to transitivity. He points
  * the semantic components of transitivity they propose do
    not all count equally, with
    “affectedness” of the object being crucial, while
    “volitionality” of the subject apparently being irrelevant.
* the components of prototype concepts have been shown to be differentially
  ranked; see Murphy (2002) for recent discussion and references
* what is the source of the ranking? if there is one
  * organization to a lexical semantic representation
  * grounded at least partially in a theory of event types.
* Dowty’s approach suggests that all the semantic determinants of argument real
  derive from the lexical entailments which verbs impose on their arguments and
  only these entailments enter into assignment of grammatical relations to arg
  * However, the picture is more complicated.
  * semantic properties relevant to argument realization which derive
    from sources other than the lexical entailments of verbs. Second,
  * some semantic properties may affect the
    morphosyntactic realization of a grammatical relation, rather than the
    choice of grammatical relation
  * We discuss these complications in turn.
* Some of Dowty’s proto-role entailments come from the choice of “filler” for
  * eg the dative verb send and dat shift;
  * three arguments: the sender, the thing sent, and the goal of transfer
  * The goal
    * need not be animate eg _The factory sent the goods to the warehouse_.
    * can be realized as the first object in a double object construction
      only if
      * animate, as in The factory sent the contractor the goods, or,
      * at least, interpretable as a potential possessor, metonymically
  * possible to argue that there are two verbs send, each with a distinct
    realization of arguments and set of entailments on the goal.
    * widespread (see chapter 7)
      * Ackerman and Moore (2001); all such alternations are taken to reflect
        differences in lexical entailments
    * see B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav [2002] for arguments against the polysemy
  * some semantic determinants of argument realization are derived from the
    properties of the fillers of argument positions (Evans 1997)
  * Ackerman and Moore (2001) argue that the proto-role entailments associated
    with a particular argument can influence
    not only its grammatical relation, but also
    the morphosyntactic expression of this grammatical relation. They
    * languages in which proto-role entailments determine the assignment of an
      oblique case to an argument which is clearly a syntactic object.
  * Evans (1997); the animacy of an NP bearing a particular semantic role –
    influences the morphosyntactic encoding of the associated grammatical rel,
    rather than the choice of this grammatical relation.
* the inventory of ~s and the definitions of particular ones have been debated
  * just as sem roles, so Dowty’s Agent and Patient Proto-roles
  * attempts both to refine and to enlarge the sets of Agent and Pat entailments
  * The most controversial of the Patient Proto-role entailments is the
    previously mentioned incremental theme entailment. Due to its
    * limitations as a predictor of argument realization,
    * Ackerman and Moore (2001/1999) propose an additional “bounding/telic
      entity” Patient Proto-role entailment, which is
      * also aspectually based, but which
        identifies a somewhat different set of arguments. Turning now to the
  * Agent Proto-role entailments
    * Primus (1999) sees many of them as “control” relation, which is
      * a reformulation of Dowty’s volitionality entailment;
    * Davis and Koenig (2000); entailments
      * “has a notion or perception of other participant(s) in event”; this
        * inspired by the work of Wechsler (1995: 35–40), apparently
        * replaces Dowty’s sentience entailment. They also propose
      * an additional Agent Proto-role entailment “possesses an entity” (2000).
        * possession plays a part in Primus’ (1999) suggestion that
          an additional, Recipient Proto-role is necessary to deal with
          object selection with dative verbs. This proto-role, which
          would be associated with recipient, addressee, and benefactive
        * shares certain/other entailments with the Agent/Pat Proto-role and
* Dowty leaves open the source of the particular lexical entailments which are
  relevant for the assignment of the proto-roles and does
  not explain why just these entailments matter for argument realization. Dowty
  * might have cognitive roots, figuring in a theory of the ontology of events,
  * explore this idea in subsequent research (Dowty 1998). In the absence of

    * Koenig and Davis (2001), Croft (1998), Primus (1999), Dowty (1991)

         Patient Protorole entailment “undergoes change of state.”
    * that one participant in the relation cannot exist without the second. Yet,
    * there is nothing that would predict such coocurrences, let alone enforce
      * there could, in principle, be an argument that causes a change of state
        without there being one that undergoes a change of state, contrary to
    * Primus (1999); “Proto-Agents and Proto-Patients are ... distinguished ...
      only by their dependency relative to each other” (1999) and argues that
      * in each pai, the Patient Proto-role entailment is dependent on the Agent
* Many of the proto-role entailments pick up on notions that figure in
  two major perspectives on event conceptualization reviewed in the next chapte.
  * Some/other approaches to lexical semantic representations are based on
  * “causal chain” representations of events, an approach
    reflected in the entailments involving causation, volition, and affectedness
    (see section 4.3). Others are
  * temporal representations, as reflected in the incremental theme entailment.
    * Tenny (1992); the clusters of proto-role entailments
      follow from her Aspectual Interface Hypothesis,
      which builds on an aspectual model of event conceptualization. She argues
      * Patient Proto-role entailments can be reduced to her aspectual notion of
        measure (see section 4.2.1)
  * Proto-roles include entailments relevant to both causal and aspectual
    * may explain why the proto-role approach has the attractive wide coverage
* an important property of Dowty’s proto-roles which distinguishes them both
  from traditional semantic roles and from other types of generalized semantic
  roles
  * As Davis (2001), Davis and Koenig (2000), and Van Valin (1999) point out,
  * Dowty’s proto-roles are not “reified”; that is, they are
    not present in the grammatical representation of a sentence,
    nor does any grammatical process refer to them.
  * figure only in the mapping from lexical semantics to syntax, and,
  * no semantic roles to arguments as an intermediate stage in the mapping. In
    * traditional view; the entailments a verb imposes on an argument are used
      to determine that argument’s semantic role, and then
      mapping rules determine its realization on the basis of this role.
* proto-roles to instantiate important conceptual categories,
  prominent in cognitive development, but lacking an explicit role in grammar
  * compared to feature decomposition
    * shared; the idea that semantic roles are not atomic, but can be decomposed
    * differs crucially both in assuming that the components are not jointly
      necessary and sufficient and components not binary and discrete, dividing

### 3.1.2 Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) 65

* Van Valin (1990, 1993b; Foley and Van Valin 1984; Van Valin and LaPolla 1997).

## 3.2 predicate decomposition 68

* basic grammatically relevant elements of verb meaning
* often called event structures
* distinction between
  * simple and complex events
  * the core meaning of a verb – its root – and the
    components of meaning that identify the verb’s event type

## 3.3 Conclusion 75

## Notes 76

1. prototype concepts in the psychological studies on human categorization by
   Rosch (1973; Rosch and Mervis 1975). The
  * bringing prototype concepts into this area of linguistic description
  * originated in Lakoff (1977). Lakoff
    * specifies properties of prototypical sentences with agent–patient verbs,
  * many of the prototypical entailments of agents and patients adopted by
    Dowty (1991) derive directly from a Lakoff-style description of such
  * Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) proposal that
    transitivity should be conceived of as a prototype notion; this proposal
    * accompanied by a listing of the semantic factors associated with a
      prototypical transitive sentence. In
  * Langacker (1990, 1993): “conceptual archetypes” underlie the notions of
    subject and object of a transitive verb
    * See Rice [1987a, 1987b] and Taylor (1989) for further develop of
  * complexity of the notions of patient and, particularly, agent that favors a
    prototype approach to semantic roles is brought out in the work of
    Cruse (1973), Fillmore (1977b), and Grimes (1975)
2. !=>
  * agree with Dowty that semantic roles are prototype notions
  * agree with him that their source is in the lexical entailments of verbs. In
  * cognitive grammar; a particular construal of a happening can determine the
    semantic role borne by an argument
3. whether unaccusativity should be treated semantically, as Dowty does, or synt
  * see Dowty (1991), as well as B. Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995),
    C. Rosen (1984), and Van Valin (1990) for extensive discussion.
4. Besides the A-case, Schlesinger (1989, 1995) introduces the C-case, a proto-
  *  has no analogue in Dowty (1991). This role subsumes
  * NPs that would traditionally bear the instrument, comitative, or manner
  * all expressed in PP with in English. As far as we know, Schlesinger’s C-case
  * are _with_ objects like subjects and objects?
    * C-case is the only generalized semantic role that is
      not motivated by the special status of subject and object
    * wide range of semantic notions expressed as objects of _with_
    * use of _with_ to indicate noncanonically realized or “displaced” themes
      (Rappaport and B. Levin 1988), as in _spray the wall with paint_,
      => _with_ objects not unlike subjects and objects.
5. Dowty (1991) only briefly mentions the dative alternation, suggesting that
  * animacy of the recipient may be implicated in the availability of
    two possible argument realizations for dative verbs. There is
  * no indication that he would handle this alternation by introducing a
    Recipient Proto-role, as Primus does.
6. In RRG, there are no grammatical relations corresponding to the traditional notions
of “subject” and “object.” The traditional properties of a subject are split between
the argument analyzed as a “syntactic pivot” and a “syntactic controller,” selected
on a construction-specific and language-specific basis. In syntactically accusative
languages, the Actor is the unmarked choice for the “privileged syntactic argument,”
which will be the pivot or controller in most constructions. Voice modulations canNotes
77
alter the choice of pivot and controller, as when the passive forces the choice of


Undergoer as pivot or controller.
7. In our event structure for an activity verb, a primitive predicate act is modified
by a manner root, as in (11), an analysis which contrasts with Hale and Keyser’s
(1993, 2002) analysis of comparable verbs, which treats the root as the argument
of a predicate do, roughly comparable to act, as in [ x do <JOG>]. This other
approach receives apparent support from Basque and some other languages, where
the counterparts of activity verbs are expressed periphrastically using the verb
meaning ‘do’ plus a noun (B. Levin 1989). We do not choose between approaches
here, since additional investigation into the representation of such verbs is needed.
8. Predicate decompositions allow a solution to a problem raised in section 2.2.2: uni-
fying the various instantiations of path found with motion verbs (e.g., to the library,
from the cafeteria, through the woods), which are assigned distinct “traditional”
semantic roles. In his predicate decompositions, Jackendoff (1983) recognizes a
conceptual category of path, which consists of a path function and a reference
object; since the path function has internal structure it provides a unified represen-
tation of all types of paths. Jackendoff then analyzes verbs of motion as based on
a two-place primitive predicate go, which takes theme and path arguments.
9. Much of the work which takes a mereological approach to aspectual classification
(Hinrichs 1985; Krifka 1992, 1998) also assumes that verbs can denote events with
subeventual structure (see section 4.2.1); however, this work is concerned with the
analysis of the aspectual notion of telicity, rather than with argument realization.
