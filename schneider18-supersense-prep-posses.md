# Abstract

* Semantic relations are often signaled with prepositional or possessive
* hE extreme polysemy bedevils their analysis and automatic interpretation
* We introduce a new annotation scheme, corpus, and task for the disamb in Eng
  * comprehensive with respect to types and tokens of these markers; use
  * broadly applicable supersense classes rather than fine-grained dict defs
  * unite prepositions and possessives under the same class inventory; and
  * distinguish between a markerâ€™s lexical contribution and the role it marks
    in the context of a predicate or scene
  * Strong interannotator agreement rates, as well as
  * encouraging disambiguation results with established supervised methods,
