chapter in Mining text data, 2012 - Springer

# Abstract 415

* This survey covering published literature during 2002-2015, is
* organized on the basis of
  * sub-tasks to be performed, machine learning and
  * techniques used and
  * applications

# 1 Intro

## 1.1 Earlier reviews

* Pang+ (2008) performed an extensive survey of 300+ papers by covering
  applications, common challenges for sentiment analysis,
  major tasks of opinion mining viz., opinion extraction, sentiment
  classification, polarity determination, and summarization
* Tang+ (2009) discussed four problems related to opinion mining, i.e.,
  subjectivity classification, word sentiment classification,
  document sentiment classification and opinion extraction
  * For subjectivity classification, they highlighted similarity dependent,
    NB classifier, Multiple NB classifier, and cut-based classifier
* O'Leary+ (2011) presented a survey on blog mining, which includes
  introduction on blog search and mining, type of blogs to be analyzed,
  unit and type of opinions to be extracted from blogs, and their applications
* Montoyo+ (2012) listed some open issues along with achievements obtained thus
  far in the area of subjectivity analysis and sentiment analysis
* Tsytsarau and Palpanas (2012) presented a survey on SA by
  * focusing on opinion mining, opinion aggregation including spam detection
    and contradiction analysis. They
  * compared opinion mining methods, which were employed on some common dataset
* Liu (2012) presented different
  * tasks
    * subjectivity and sentiment classification, aspect-based SA,
      sentiment lexicon generation, opinion summarization,
      analysis of comparative opinions, opinion search and retrieval,
      opinion spam detection and quality of reviews
  * works published in SA and opinion mining
* Cambria+ (2015) pointed out complexities involved in SA with respect to
  current demand along with possible future research directions
* Feldman (2013) focused on five specific problems in the field of SA:
  Document-level SA, sentence-level SA, aspect-based SA, comparative SA and,
  sentiment lexicon acquisition
  * open issues like SA of composition statement, automatic entity recognition,
    discussion on multi-entity in same review, sarcasm detection and
    subjectivity classification at finer level
* Most recently, Medhat+ (2014) presented a survey on
  * feature selection and
    * brief description is presented about feature selection methods
      (mainly pointwise mutual information and Chi-square)
  * sentiment classification methods
    * detailed discussion is presented on sentiment classification methods
    * fifty-four articles listing out task accomplished, domain,
      algorithm utilized, polarity, data scope, data source, and  language.
  * major concern is to discuss the techniques applied in surveyed papers
* Along with these surveyed papers, a considerable amount of work has been
  reported in this area and a number of lexica have been created
  * micro-blogs, which have been
    * especially in the last four years,
    * successfully applied for market prediction [18], social advertising [43],
      and box-office prediction [51].
    * Tsytsarau and Palpanas [137] presented very limited discussion
* urgent need to focus on several other issues
  raised in currently published papers, not the part of the extant surveys
* This survey work differs from existing literature surveys in various ways
  1. we classified studies on the basis of tasks, approaches and
     applications as presented in Figure 1,
  1. presents articles related to tasks and major issues
     subjectivity classification,
     sentiment classification from coarse-grained to fine-grained level,
     review usefulness measurement, opinion spam detection, lexicon creation,
     and opinion word and product aspect extraction
  1. we summarized each of surveyed articles in four aspects viz.
    problem addressed, exploited dataset details,
    feature representation and selection method (if applied),
    techniques applied, obtained results, and
    indicated future directions along with our views,
  1. we included some recently proposed feature selection techniques for SA,
  1. we provided a detailed list of online available datasets,
  1. classification of articles on the basis of SA performed at
    various granular levels as presented in Table 1,
  1. the exploited lexica are listed in Table 10, and
  1. summary of one hundred and sixty one articles is presented in Table 10

# 2. background information related to the survey

# 3. SOTA discussion on SA covering common issues listed in previous paragraph

* subsection 3.1--subsection 3.5 discuss different tasks and sub-tasks
  along with applied approaches and techniques
  * approaches are broadly classified into three categories viz.
    machine learning, lexicon based, and hybrid approaches
    for subjectivity classification, sentiment classification,
    review helpfulness measurement, and opinion spam detection as presented in
    Figure 1.  Further,
* ontology and non-ontology based approaches are considered
  for lexicon creation and aspect extraction

### 3.2.1.1 Machine learning based approaches [to Polarity determination]

* subsection 3.6 presents applications of SA

# 4. discussion..., open issues, and possible applications of sentiment analysis

# 5. concluded in section 5
