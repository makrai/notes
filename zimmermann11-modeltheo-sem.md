# Abstract

* Model-theoretic semantics is a special form of truth-conditional semantics.
  * the truth-values of sentences depend on certain abstract objects, models.
  * models are mathematical structures that provide the interpretations of the
  * Originally designed for the semantic analysis of mathematical logic,
  * standard in linguistic semantics, mostly through the impact of R Montague
* frequently (and loosely) identified with possible worlds semantics, which
  rests on an identification of sentence meanings with regions in Logical
  Space, the class of all possible worlds. In fact, the two approaches have much
  in common and are not always easy to keep apart. In a sense, 
  * model-theoretic semantics can be thought of as a restricted form/gen of
    possible worlds semantics
    * restricted: where models represent possible worlds; in
    * generalization: treating Logical Space as variable rather than given.
* we: an introductory exposition of model-theoretic semantics
  also covers possible worlds semantics – hopefully helping to disentangle the
  relationship between the two approaches. It starts with a general discussion
  of truth-conditional semantics (section 1), the
main purpose of which is to provide some 
Model-theoretic semantics is then
(i).
  The fi nal section 3 turns to model theory

# 1. Truth-conditional semantics

* motivation and background.
* tight connection between meaning and truth
* From a pre-theoretic point of view, linguistic meaning may appear a
  multi-faceted blend of phenomena, partly subjective and private, partly social
  and inter-subjective, mostly vague, slippery, and apparently hard to define
  * there are a few unshakable, yet substantial (non-tautological) insights into
  * differences in truth-value necessitate differences in meaning:
* meaning is primarily sentence meaning; for sentences are the bearers of truth,
* truth-conditional semantics, anything beyond this most marked trait of
  sentence meanings ought to be left out of consideration (or to pragmatics),
  * Wittgenstein (1922)
  * much of its flavour, as well as some of its problems, to this immediate
    consequence of the BP, to which we will return in section 2.
* The – common – identification of sentence meanings with truth conditions
  requires further motivation, which may be in functionalist considerations:
  * truth conditions suffice to explain the extralinguistic rôles attributed to
    sentence meaning in social interaction and cognitive processes. Though we
  * we will later see examples of covarying entities – the material models
    introduced in Section 2.3 – that are less likely to be identified with sen-
    tence meanings than truth conditions in the sense envisaged here. Bearing
* most radical form Frege (1884: 71)
  * derive the meanings of non-sentential expressions from sentence meanings
  * Without any further specification and constraints, this characterisation of
    nonsentential meaning is bound to be incomplete. To begin with,
  * the contribution an expression obviously depends on the position in which it occurs:
  * positions p can be identified with (certain) partial, injective functions
    on the domain of expressions, inserting occupants into hosts, so that an
    (occupant) expression A occurs in position p of a (host) expression B just
    in case p(A) = B. Positions in sentences are
  * these are structural positions that need not coincide with surface pos
  * in structurally ambiguous (surface) sentences depend on the latters’
    readings
  * can hardly be determined by looking at one sentence in isolation. Otherwise
  (1/2) Someone is buying/selling a car.
  * (1) and (2) have the same truth conditions and the same overall structure,
    * the verbs occupy the same position. Since the two sentences are otherwise
    * it would seem that the two verbs make the same contribution. If so, this
    * these verbs do differ in their truth-conditional contributions, as in:
      (3/4) Mary is buying/selling a car
* V's meanings can only be identified taking into account all positions in which
  * ie sameness of meaning among any non-sentential expressions A and B (of the
    same category) requires sameness of truth-conditional contribution
    throughout the structural positions of all sentences. Since A and B occupy
  * of the same category: not rule out the possibility that two expressions make
    the same truth-conditional contribution without being grammatically equiv.
    * Gazdar+ (1985: 32), _likely_ and _probable_ may be cases in point – given
* Subst leaves open what kinds of entities the meanings of non-sentential
  expressions are. Keeping the ‘minimalist’ spirit behind the passage from the
  * tempting to identify them by strengthening Subst to a bi-conditional,
  * hE, we will depart from radical truth-conditional semantics and not take it
    * counterexamples will be addressed in due course.
* various synonymous (non-sentential) expressions may be replaced simultaneously.  
  * the meaning of any complex expression can be construed as only depending of
    the meanings of its immediate parts – thus giving rise to a famous
  * Principle of Compositionality [Compo]
  * may be A'=a, B'b, A''=b, B''=a, where '' is an alternative truth-conditional
    account 
  * We will take a closer look at this argument in section 3.  
* a particular concept of non-sentential meaning,
  some choices might be more natural than others. Indeed, Subst falls out
  * if the meaning of an expressions A is identified with
    the set of all expressions with which A can be replaced without any change
    in truth conditions, then Subst trivially holds. However,
  * hE, there is a serious problem with this strategy: if (non-sentential)
    * language-dependent. But if meanings were just substitution classes, then
    * change their meanings each time a new word is added to it! 
    * This speaks against a construal of meanings in terms of abstraction,
    * even though synonymy classes have proved useful as representatives of
      meanings in the algebraic study of compositionality; cf.  Hodges (2001).
* criteria for deciding whether two expressions of different languages have
  the same meaning. Hence a substantial theory of nonsentential meaning cannot
  * finding a natural analogue to the MCP that goes beyond sentences. The most
  * If T 1 and T 2 are terms such that, under given circumstances, T 1 refers to
    something to which T 2 does not refer, then T 1 and T 2 differ in meaning.  
  * term: an expression that may be said to refer to something.
  * Proper names, definite descriptions, and pronouns are cases in point. Thus,
    * in an email to Manfred Kupffer, I can use (iii) the _you_ to refer to him.
    * the two terms mentioned in the RPP must be understood as being used in the
      same context. Under different (past or counterfactual) circumstances, (ii)
      may refer to another person, or to no one at all; the RPP only mentions
  * For the purpose of this survey we will also assume that names with more than
    one bearer, like (i), are lexically ambiguous;
  * the terms in the RPP must therefore be taken as disambiguated expressions
* Why should the RPP be less certain than the MCP? One possible reason comes
  * ontology: referring terms is not necessarily clearly defined (Williams 2005)
  * whatever _terms_ may be, they must somehow determine their ref conditions,
    as depending on the circumstances.  According to a certain brand of truth-
    conditional semantics, anything beyond this most marked trait of term
    meanings ought to be left out of consideration (or to pragmatics), thus
* stronger version of our ‘minimalist’ semantic axiom:
  * any two terms agree in meaning => they agree in their reference
    conditions.
  * The common <= also requires further ‘external’ evidence. However, as in
  * Subst, the EBP may then be used to determine the meanings of at least some
    non-sentential expressions
    in a non-arbitrary and at the same time language-independent way, employing
    a heuristics based on: 
* Frege’s Functional Principle [FFP]
  * If not specified by the EBP, the meaning of an expression A is the meaning
    of (certain) expressions in which A occurs as functionally depending on A’s
    occurrence.
  * ie the meaning of an expression A that is not a sentence or a term, 
    is a function assigning meanings of host expressions (in which A occurs) to
    meanings of positions (in which A occurs) – where the latter can be made out
    in case the positions coincide with adjacent expressions whose meanings have
    been independently identified – either by the EBP, or by previous
    applications of the same strategy
  * e.g. the meanings of (coordinating) conjunctions C (like and and or) may be
    determined from their occurrences in unembedded coordinations of sentences A
    and B, i.e.  sentences of the form A C B; these occurrences are completely
  * simple predications of the form T P (where T is a term),
    the meanings of predicates P come out as functions 
  * the result may in turn be used to obtain the meanings of transitive verbs V,
  * a large variety of expressions can be assigned meanings whose function is to
    contribute to truth and reference conditions without depending on any
    particular language
* Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons, following FFP this way does not settle
  the issue of determining meaning in a fully principled, non-arbitrary way: –
  * which of a given number of grammatical constructions ought to serve defi
    purpose above; and the choice may influence the meanings obtained by applying
  * Quantifier phrases – expressions like nobody; most linguists; every atom in
    * Customarily they are analyzed by putting them in subject position and thus
      * functions from predicate meanings (determined in the way above) to
        sentence meanings (determined by the EBP). 
    * hW, they also occur in a host of other environments, e.g. as DOs. If the
      * would come out as functions from transitive verb meanings (determined in
        the way above) to predicate meanings (determined in the way above); and
    * if both environments were taken together, they would be
      functions defined on both predicate and verb meanings, etc.
    * Although there are one-one correspondences between these different constru
      * none of them can lay claim to being more natural than the others.  –
  * no guarantee that the meaning of an expression will behave compositionally
    beyond the primary occurrences chosen. For instance, it is well known that
    * eg the meaning of _and_ determined along the above lines, can be put to
      work in predicate coordinations such as sing and dance – basically due to
      the existence of corresponding clausal paraphrases of the form x sings and
      * not (or not so easily) adapted to cover ‘collective’ readings of
        coordinate proper names as in John and Mary are performing a duet.  –
  * the range of meanings covered by the primary occurrences of an expression
    may be restricted in various ways, sometimes by accidental gaps in the lex
    * eg the predicate meanings will depend on what terms there are, and what
  * in order to make the meanings thus determined general enough, their
    construction often crucially involves a certain amount of idealisation.
    * idealisations frequently go far beyond the inclusion of hard-to-describe
      objects as referents. As a result, the synonymy criterion mentioned above
* before FFP, trying to proceed in a bottom-up fashion, had encountered
  serious difficulties when it came to distinguishing the various modes of
  composing phrasal from lexical meanings. By changing the direction of
  * confined to (combinations of) content words, FFP
* FFP solves offers a much more differentiated picture of the varieties of
  meaning: combination mostly proceeds by functional application, and 
  * make all expressions amenable to semantic analysis,
    including functional ones such as determiners and conjunctions.
