# Abstract

* Model-theoretic semantics is a special form of truth-conditional semantics.
  * the truth-values of sentences depend on certain abstract objects, models.
  * models are mathematical structures that provide the interpretations of the
  * Originally designed for the semantic analysis of mathematical logic,
  * standard in linguistic semantics, mostly through the impact of R Montague
* frequently (and loosely) identified with possible worlds semantics, which
  rests on an identification of sentence meanings with regions in Logical
  Space, the class of all possible worlds. In fact, the two approaches have much
  in common and are not always easy to keep apart. In a sense,
  * model-theoretic semantics can be thought of as a restricted form/gen of
    possible worlds semantics
    * restricted: where models represent possible worlds; in
    * generalization: treating Logical Space as variable rather than given.
* we: an introductory exposition of model-theoretic semantics
  also covers possible worlds semantics – hopefully helping to disentangle the
  relationship between the two approaches.

# 1. Truth-conditional semantics

* motivation and background.
* tight connection between meaning and truth
* From a pre-theoretic point of view, linguistic meaning may appear a
  multi-faceted blend of phenomena, partly subjective and private, partly social
  and inter-subjective, mostly vague, slippery, and apparently hard to define
  * there are a few unshakable, yet substantial (non-tautological) insights into
  * differences in truth-value necessitate differences in meaning:
* meaning is primarily sentence meaning; for sentences are the bearers of truth,
* truth-conditional semantics, anything beyond this most marked trait of
  sentence meanings ought to be left out of consideration (or to pragmatics),
  * Wittgenstein (1922)
  * much of its flavour, as well as some of its problems, to this immediate
    consequence of the BP, to which we will return in section 2.
* The – common – identification of sentence meanings with truth conditions
  requires further motivation, which may be in functionalist considerations:
  * truth conditions suffice to explain the extralinguistic rôles attributed to
    sentence meaning in social interaction and cognitive processes. Though we
  * we will later see examples of covarying entities – the material models
    introduced in Section 2.3 – that are less likely to be identified with sen-
    tence meanings than truth conditions in the sense envisaged here. Bearing
* most radical form Frege (1884: 71)
  * derive the meanings of non-sentential expressions from sentence meanings
  * Without any further specification and constraints, this characterisation of
    nonsentential meaning is bound to be incomplete. To begin with,
  * the contribution an expression obviously depends on the position in which it occurs:
  * positions p can be identified with (certain) partial, injective functions
    on the domain of expressions, inserting occupants into hosts, so that an
    (occupant) expression A occurs in position p of a (host) expression B just
    in case p(A) = B. Positions in sentences are
  * these are structural positions that need not coincide with surface pos
  * in structurally ambiguous (surface) sentences depend on the latters’
    readings
  * can hardly be determined by looking at one sentence in isolation. Otherwise
  (1/2) Someone is buying/selling a car.
  * (1) and (2) have the same truth conditions and the same overall structure,
    * the verbs occupy the same position. Since the two sentences are otherwise
    * it would seem that the two verbs make the same contribution. If so, this
    * these verbs do differ in their truth-conditional contributions, as in:
      (3/4) Mary is buying/selling a car
* V's meanings can only be identified taking into account all positions in which
  * ie sameness of meaning among any non-sentential expressions A and B (of the
    same category) requires sameness of truth-conditional contribution
    throughout the structural positions of all sentences. Since A and B occupy
  * of the same category: not rule out the possibility that two expressions make
    the same truth-conditional contribution without being grammatically equiv.
    * Gazdar+ (1985: 32), _likely_ and _probable_ may be cases in point – given
* Subst leaves open what kinds of entities the meanings of non-sentential
  expressions are. Keeping the ‘minimalist’ spirit behind the passage from the
  * tempting to identify them by strengthening Subst to a bi-conditional,
  * hE, we will depart from radical truth-conditional semantics and not take it
    * counterexamples will be addressed in due course.
* various synonymous (non-sentential) expressions may be replaced simultaneously.
  * the meaning of any complex expression can be construed as only depending of
    the meanings of its immediate parts – thus giving rise to a famous
  * Principle of Compositionality [Compo]
  * may be A'=a, B'b, A''=b, B''=a, where '' is an alternative truth-conditional
    account
  * We will take a closer look at this argument in section 3.
* a particular concept of non-sentential meaning,
  some choices might be more natural than others. Indeed, Subst falls out
  * if the meaning of an expressions A is identified with
    the set of all expressions with which A can be replaced without any change
    in truth conditions, then Subst trivially holds. However,
  * hE, there is a serious problem with this strategy: if (non-sentential)
    * language-dependent. But if meanings were just substitution classes, then
    * change their meanings each time a new word is added to it!
    * This speaks against a construal of meanings in terms of abstraction,
    * even though synonymy classes have proved useful as representatives of
      meanings in the algebraic study of compositionality; cf.  Hodges (2001).
* criteria for deciding whether two expressions of different languages have
  the same meaning. Hence a substantial theory of nonsentential meaning cannot
  * finding a natural analogue to the MCP that goes beyond sentences. The most
  * If T 1 and T 2 are terms such that, under given circumstances, T 1 refers to
    something to which T 2 does not refer, then T 1 and T 2 differ in meaning.
  * term: an expression that may be said to refer to something.
  * Proper names, definite descriptions, and pronouns are cases in point. Thus,
    * in an email to Manfred Kupffer, I can use (iii) the _you_ to refer to him.
    * the two terms mentioned in the RPP must be understood as being used in the
      same context. Under different (past or counterfactual) circumstances, (ii)
      may refer to another person, or to no one at all; the RPP only mentions
  * For the purpose of this survey we will also assume that names with more than
    one bearer, like (i), are lexically ambiguous;
  * the terms in the RPP must therefore be taken as disambiguated expressions
* Why should the RPP be less certain than the MCP? One possible reason comes
  * ontology: referring terms is not necessarily clearly defined (Williams 2005)
  * whatever _terms_ may be, they must somehow determine their ref conditions,
    as depending on the circumstances.  According to a certain brand of truth-
    conditional semantics, anything beyond this most marked trait of term
    meanings ought to be left out of consideration (or to pragmatics), thus
* stronger version of our ‘minimalist’ semantic axiom:
  * any two terms agree in meaning => they agree in their reference
    conditions.
  * The common <= (called EBP) also requires further ‘external’ evidence.
  * Subst, the EBP may then be used to determine the meanings of at least some
    non-sentential expressions
    in a non-arbitrary and at the same time language-independent way, employing
    a heuristics based on:
* Frege’s Functional Principle [FFP]
  * If not specified by the EBP,
    the meaning of an expression A is the meaning of (certain) expressions in
    which A occurs as functionally depending on A’s occurrence.
  * ie the meaning of an expression A that is not a sentence or a term,
    is a function assigning meanings of host expressions (in which A occurs) to
    meanings of positions (in which A occurs) – where the latter can be made out
    in case the positions coincide with adjacent expressions whose meanings have
    been independently identified – either by the EBP, or by previous
    applications of the same strategy
  * e.g. the meanings of (coordinating) conjunctions C (like and and or) may be
    determined from their occurrences in unembedded coordinations of sentences A
    and B, i.e.  sentences of the form A C B; these occurrences are completely
  * simple predications of the form T P (where T is a term),
    the meanings of predicates P come out as functions
  * the result may in turn be used to obtain the meanings of transitive verbs V,
  * a large variety of expressions can be assigned meanings whose function is to
    contribute to truth and reference conditions without depending on any
    particular language
* Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons, following FFP this way does not settle
  the issue of determining meaning in a fully principled, non-arbitrary way: –
  * which of a given number of grammatical constructions ought to serve defi
    purpose above; and the choice may influence the meanings obtained by applying
  * Quantifier phrases – expressions like nobody; most linguists; every atom in
    * Customarily they are analyzed by putting them in subject position and thus
      * functions from predicate meanings (determined in the way above) to
        sentence meanings (determined by the EBP).
    * hW, they also occur in a host of other environments, e.g. as DOs. If the
      * would come out as functions from transitive verb meanings (determined in
        the way above) to predicate meanings (determined in the way above); and
    * if both environments were taken together, they would be
      functions defined on both predicate and verb meanings, etc.
    * Although there are one-one correspondences between these different constru
      * none of them can lay claim to being more natural than the others.  –
  * no guarantee that the meaning of an expression will behave compositionally
    beyond the primary occurrences chosen. For instance, it is well known that
    * eg the meaning of _and_ determined along the above lines, can be put to
      work in predicate coordinations such as sing and dance – basically due to
      the existence of corresponding clausal paraphrases of the form x sings and
      * not (or not so easily) adapted to cover ‘collective’ readings of
        coordinate proper names as in John and Mary are performing a duet.  –
  * the range of meanings covered by the primary occurrences of an expression
    may be restricted in various ways, sometimes by accidental gaps in the lex
    * eg the predicate meanings will depend on what terms there are, and what
  * in order to make the meanings thus determined general enough, their
    construction often crucially involves a certain amount of idealisation.
    * idealisations frequently go far beyond the inclusion of hard-to-describe
      objects as referents. As a result, the synonymy criterion mentioned above
* before FFP, trying to proceed in a bottom-up fashion, had encountered
  serious difficulties when it came to distinguishing the various modes of
  composing phrasal from lexical meanings. By changing the direction of
  * confined to (combinations of) content words, FFP
* FFP offers a much more differentiated picture of the varieties of meaning:
  combination mostly proceeds by functional application, and
  * make all expressions amenable to semantic analysis,
    including functional ones such as determiners and conjunctions.

## 2.1. Logical Space

* extension: the object that the meaning of an expression determines (for given
  circumstances, Carnap 1947). In other words, the extension
  * of a sentence is its truth value; and the extension
  * of a term is its referent. It is a remarkable fact that
  * the above strategy for determining meanings may be used to generalize the
    notion of extension to a wide range of expressions
  * the extension of an expression A as a function assigning
    extensions of host expressions ->
    extensions of positions in which A occurs.  We thus have what may be called
  * the Extensional Version of Frege’s Functional Principle
  * the extensions of coordinating conjunctions may be determined from their
  * the extensions of predicates come out as functions assigning truth values
    * characteristic functions of sets of individuals, i.e. functions from
  * in turn, transitive verbs come out as curried binary relations,
    i.e.  functions assigning characteristic functions to individuals (= the
    * the curried version of R assigns the characteristic
      function of {y∈U | (y, x)∈R} to any individual x∈U. It is not hard to see
  * the extensions of quantifier phrases can be identified as (character-
    istic functions of) sets of predicate extensions; and
    * once nouns are regarded as synonymous with predicates,
    the extensions of determiners: (curried) relations among predicate exts.
  * extension of
    everybody = supersets of the set of all persons; the extension of
    no = the relation of disjointness among sets of individuals; etc. Since
  * 1 is crucial because 2
    * this generalisation of predicate extensions to functions operating on
      arbitrary individuals
    * the truth value of a sentence with a quantifier in subject position may
      depend on the value of the predicate extension for nameless individuals,
* this extensional adaptation is much more limited in its application than FFP
  * it only works as long as extensions behave compositionally; otherwise it is
  * and there are a number of environments that cannot be analyzed by
    compositionally combining extensions. Still, a considerable portion of the
* truth conditions and reference conditions (in the sense intended here): since
  * functions assigning truth values to referents as depending on circumstances
  * presupposes that, whatever circumstances form a set that may serve as dom
  * the set of circumstances is
    * vast, and that Circumstances may be as hypothetical as can be.
    * its members do not miss a detail: Circumstances are as specific as can be.
* Vastness reflects the raison d’être of circumstances in semantic theory:
  * circumstances serve to differentiate the meanings of non-synonymous
    sentences and terms by providing them with distinct truth values and
    referents, respectively. In order to fulfill this task in an adequate way,
  * actual circumstances – those met in the actual world – obviously do not
    suffice, as a random example shows:
    (5) The physicist who discovered the X-rays died in Munich.
    (6) The first Nobel laureate in physics died in Munich.
    * it so happens that the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered a
      phenomenon known as X-rays in 1895, was subsequently awarded the first
      Nobel prize in physics in 1901, and died in Munich in 1923. Hence the
    * subjects refer to the same person, and both are true
    * hE, not synonymous, and neither are the definite descriptions in their
      subject position. In order to reflect these semantic differences in their
    * circumstances are called for under which (5) and (6) differ in truth
      value and, consequently, their subjects do not corefer. Such
  * it is hardly foreseeable what kinds of differences are needed in order to
    separate two non-synonymous sentences or terms by circumstances under which
    their extensions do not coincide, we will assume that
    any conceivable circumstances count as evidence for non-synonymy,
    however far-fetched or bizarre they may be. The following pair, inspired by
* Macbeath (1982), is a case in point:
  (7) Dr Who ate himself.
  (8) Dr Who is his own father.
  * there better be circumstances that contradict current science, thereby
* The point of Detail is that counterfactual (= non-actual) circumstances are
  just as specific. Hence if I had been on a space shuttle instead of riding a
* ordinary conception of worlds of imagination or fiction: stories and novels
  usually, nay always, leave open a lot of details – like the exact number of

* Logical Space: the set of all actual and counterfactual circumstances

  * elements of Logical Space as possible worlds rather than circumstances,
  * it will be left open here whether possible worlds are all-inclusive
    agglomerations of facts, or whether they could also correspond to more
    mundane, medium-sized situations. What is important is that Logical Space
* cannot guarantee that any two sentences that appear to differ in meaning also
  differ in their truth conditions. Thus, e.g., (9)–(10) are true of precisely
  (9) General Beauregard Lee is a woodchuck.
  (10) General Beauregard Lee is a groundhog, and either he lives in Georgia,
       or he does not live in Georgia.

      this equation generalises to arbitrary expressions A with extensions that
      have been constructed by applying (the extensional version of) FFP; for
* a typical analysis of a simple example
  within the framework of possible worlds semantics:
  (11) Every boy fancies Mary and Jane pouts [duzzog]
  ||every‖ w = λP. λQ. ⊢P ⊆ Q⊣
  ||boy|| w = λx. ⊢x is a boy in w⊣
  ||fancies|| w = λx. λy . ⊢y fancies x in w⊣
  ||Mary|| w = Mary; ||Jane|| w = Jane

  * the obvious temporal dependence of the right-hand sides of the equations
    (12b) and (12c) have been suppressed and may be thought of as being
* their extensions can be derived by functional application

## 2.2. Material models 12

* in order to specify the extensions of arbitrary (extensional) expressions,spc
  * the extensions of all (extensional) lexical expressions and
  * (b) the way the (extensional) grammatical constructions combine them.
* If these constructions constitute the primary contexts of expressions
  analyzed in terms of (the extensional version of FFP), (b) is always a matter
  of functional application
* Other (extensional) constructions may require some ingenuity
  to determine the precise way in which extensions combine.
  * Quantified objects are an infamous case in point. As the reader may verify,
  * the extension of a predicate of the form V Q, where V is transitive verb
    and Q is a quantifier phrase (in direct object position), can be given by
    the following equation: (15) ‖V Q‖ w = λx. ‖Q‖ w
    (λy. ‖V‖ w (y)(x))
Like (14), equation (15) completely specifi es the extension of a certain kind of
complex expression in terms of the extensions of its immediate parts; and it does so
in a perfectly general manner, for arbitrary worlds w. By definition, this is so for
all extensional constructions, which are extensional precisely in that the extensions of
the expressions they combine determine the extensions of the resulting phrases,
thus giving rise to general equations like (14) or (15). In particular, then, the combi-
* (b) does not depend on the particular circumstances envisaged. It thus turns
* ie the world dependence of extensions is just a matter of lexical spec (a)
  cation (a). hence the rôle worlds play in the determination of extensions
  can be seen as being restricted to the extensions of lexical expressions –
  the rest is compositionality, captured by general equations like (14) and
  (15). To the extent that the determination of extensions is the only rôle
  possible worlds w play in (compositional extensional) semantics, they could
  be identifi ed with functions assigning extensions to lexical expressions.
  If A is a lexical expression, we would thus have:
* (16) ‖A‖ w = F w (A)
  * F w is a function assigning to any expression in its domain the extension
    of that expression at world w
  * What is the domain of F w ? It has just been noted that
    * it only contains lexical expressions – but does it include all of them? A
      brief reflection shows that this need not even be so; for some of the
      equations of the form (16) do not depend on a
    particular choice of w. For instance, as noted above, under any cir-
    cumstances w the extension of a (sentence-) coordinating conjunction and is
    a binary function on truth values; the same goes for other ‘logical’
    particles: (17) a. ‖and‖ w = λu. λv. u × v b. ‖or‖ w = λu. λv. (u + v) – (u
    × v)
c. ‖not‖ w = λu. 1 – u
[= (12e)]

The equations in (17) imply that, in any worlds w and w', the extensions of and, or, and
not remain stable: ‖and‖ w = ‖and‖ w' , ‖or‖ w = ‖or‖ w' , and ‖not‖ w = ‖not‖ w' . This being
so, the specifi cations of the world-dependent extensions of lexical expressions may safely
skip such logical words. A similar case can be made for quantificational determiners and
the is of identity:
(18) a. ‖every‖ w = λP. λQ. ⊢P ⊆ Q⊣
* in (18) ‘x’ and ‘y’ stand for individuals and ‘P’ and ‘Q’ for
*  which, and how many, individuals there are, depends on the particular world
   w. As a consequence, the equations in (18) do depend on w, a fact which is
   obscured by our loose notation. On the other hand, the latter three
   equations only depend on what the set of all individuals in the world w is.
   In other words, their truth does not depend on the particularities of the
   world but (at most) on the domain of individuals. In this respect, logical
   words as analyzed in (17) and (18) are atypical: the extensions of the vast
   majority of lexical expressions do vary across Logical Space and also depend
   on more than what the domain of individuals is. As far as their extensions
   concerned, lexical equations like (19) represent the more typical cases than
   (17) and (18):
(19) ‖boy‖ w = λx. ⊢x is a boy in w⊣
[= (12b)]

* thus three kinds of lexical expressions:
  * truth-functional ones, whose extension remains the very same across worlds
  * combinatorial ones, whose extension depends only on the domain of indivs
  * non-logical ones, whose extensions may depend on all sorts of worldly facts
* the material model (for L based on w) is the pair M w = (U w ,F w )
  * the domain of individuals U w in w and
  * the lexical interpretation function F w which assigns to every non-logical
    lexical expression A of L the extension of A at w.
* presupposing a prior and independent specifi cation of the non-logical
  vocabulary N L of the language L under scrutiny – and thus implies that the
  interpretation functions of any two material models share their domain, which
  is precisely the set N L . It should then be clear how the extensions of
  arbitrary expressions A of a language L can be characterised in terms of, and
  as depending on, material models M w = (U w ,F w ). This characterisation can
  be given in the form of an inductive definition, which starts out with the
  lexical material and then moves on step by step, following the grammatical
  construction principles of L, which derive (analysed and disambiguated)
  complex expressions from their (immediate) parts, thereby cre-
ating an increase in syntactic complexity. The following sample clauses offer a glimpse
of the overall structure and content of such a definition for an extensional fragment E
of English:
(20) For any expression A of E and any material model M w = (U w ,F w ) for E, the exten-
sion of A relative to M w – |A| M w – is determined by the following induction (on the
grammatical complexity of A):
(i-a)
…
|and| M w = λu. λv. u × v

… where u∈{0, 1} and v∈{0, 1}

In order to complete (29), clauses (i) and (ii) would have to take care of all logical words
* semantic characterisation of logical words that helps to draw the line
  * We have already seen that one characteristic feature of logical words is
    that their extension is largely world-independent: it may depend on which
  * hE the intensions of proper names as constant functions over Logical Space
    Kripke (1972), where terms with constant intensions are called rigid design
    even if its bearer turned
out to be present in every possible world. What, then, makes a word, or an expression
  * intuition that the extension of a logical word can be described in purely
    structural terms. As a case in point, the determiner _no_ is logical because
    its extension may be described as the relation that holds between two sets
    of individuals just in case they do not overlap – or, in terms of
    characteristic functions: that function which, successively applied to two
    characteristic functions (of sets of individuals), yields (the truth value)
    1 just in case these functions do not both assign 1 to any individual. If
  * functions as configurations of arrows leading from arguments
  * the extension of a logical word can be described solely in terms of the
    abstract arrangement of these arrows, without mentioning any particular
    individuals or other extensions – apart from the truth values. In other
    words, the descriptions do not depend on the identity of the individuals,
    which may be anything – or replaced by any other individuals. The idea,
  * logical words as having extensions that are stable under any replacement of
    individuals. In order to make this intuition precise, a bit of
  * type notation should come in handy.
    * classify the extensions of expressions according to whether they derive
      (i) from the EBP, or
      * the extensions of sentences/terms are said to be of type t/e
      (ii) by application of FFP:
      * if the extension of an expression operates on extensions of some type a
        resulting in extensions of some type b, it is said to be of type (a,b).
* expressions' types remain the same throughout Logical Space. The function
  * the type assignment of L: τ L assigning to each expression of a language L
    the unique type of its extensions ; we take τ L to be
  * part of the specifi cation of the language L
* replacement
  * Given (not necessarily distinct) possible worlds w and w',
    a replacement (of w by w') is
    a bijective function from the domain of individuals of w to that of w'
  * may then be generalized from individuals (of type e) to all types of
    extensions: given a replacement ρ (from w to w'), the following recursive
    equations define corresponding functions ρ a , for each type a: – ρ e = ρ;
    – ρ t = { (0,0),(1,1)} [= λx. x, where ‘x’ ranges over truth values];
– ρ (a,b) = λf. {(ρ a (x), ρ b (y)| f(x) = y} [where ‘f’ ranges over functions of type (a,b)].

In other words, the generalised replacement leaves truth values untouched – because
they define the structure of extensions like characteristic functions – and maps functional
extensions to corresponding functions, replacing arrows from x to y by arrows between
substitutes; it is readily seen that, for any type a, ρ a is the identical mapping on the exten-
sions of type a if (and only if) ρ is the identical mapping on the domain of individuals.

Given the above generalisation of replacements from individuals to objects of arbitrary
types, a logical word A can be defined as one whose extensions cannot be affected by
replace ments. More precisely, if ƒ is an intension of type a (i.e. a function from W to
extensions of type a), then ƒ is (replacement-) invariant just in case for any replacements
ρ and ρ' of w by some world w', it holds that ρ α (f (w)) = ρ' α (f (w)); and logical words may
then be character ised as lexical expressions A with invariant intensions: ρ τ(A) (‖A‖ w ) =
ρ' τ(A) (‖A‖ w ), for any worlds w and replacements ρ and ρ' of w by some world w'.

The definition implies that ρ τ(A) (‖A‖ w ) = ‖A‖ w , whenever A is a logical word and ρ is a
replacement from a world w to itself (or any world with the same domain of individuals) –
which is a classical criterion of logicality, going back to Lindenbaum & Tarski (1935), and
rediscovered by a number of scholars since; cf. MacFarlane (2008: Section 5) for a survey.

Extensive treatments of replacements in (models of) Logical Space can be found in Fine
(1977) and Rabinowicz (1979).

Derivatively, we will also call extensions of types a invariant if they happen to be the
values of invariant intensions of type a. Invariant extensions are always of a peculiar,
combinatorial kind. In particular, and ignoring all too small universes (of cardinalities
1 and 2), extensions of type e are never invariant; there are only two invariant extensions
of type (e,t), viz. the empty one and the universe; and four of type (e,(e,t)), viz. identity,
distinctness, and the two trivial (empty and universal) binary relations; extensions of type
((e,t),t) are invariant just in case they classify sets of individuals according to their cardi-
nalities; etc. As a consequence, the ex tensions of logical words are severely limited by the
invariance criterion. Still, it takes more for an intension to be invariant than just having
invariant extensions; in particular, a function that assigns different invariant extensions
to worlds with the same domain cannot be invariant. More generally, if the domains
U and U' of two material models M and M' have the same cardinality, the invariance
condition on logical words of the second kind (ii) en sure that, intuitively speaking, they
have analogous extensions. Thus, e.g., a determiner whose extension relative to M is the
subset-relation on U will denote the subset on U' in M'.

However, if U and U' have different cardinalities, logicality does not exclude that
the extension varies between, say, subsethood on U and disjointness on U'. Analogous
observations can be made in connection with the logical operations associated with syn-
tactic constructions. Unfortunately, there seems to be no generally agreed identifi cation
procedure of extensions across varying domains to exclude such cardinality-sensitive
shifts; cf. Machover (1994: 1081ff); Casanovas (2007). We will briefly return to this point
in Section 3.1.

The reader may now verify for himor herself that all extensions specifi ed in clauses
(i) and (ii) of (20) are indeed invariant. It may also be noted that the combinations speci-
fi ed in clause (iv) are invariant once they are themselves construed as extensions: the
compositional combination of extensions generally proceeds by way of purely structural
operations, corresponding to invariant functional extensions. The reader is reminded that
we restrict attention to extensional constructions; non-extensional compositionality will
be addressed in the following section.

The gaps in (20), then, are meant to be fi lled in as follows. The extensions of truth-
functional logical words, i.e. those whose type consists of ts, commas, and brackets only,
are specifi ed in clause (i); and this specifi cation is entirely independent of any particular
world. The extensions of all other logical words (which, for lack of a better term, we
continue to call combinatorial) are specifi ed in clause (ii); their intensions are invariant,
and their extensions in general depend on the domain of individuals. Finally, the ways in
which the extensions of complex expressions depend on the extensions of their imme-
diate parts, correspond to invariant (and generally domain-dependent) functional exten-
sions and are specifi ed in clause (iv), according to the syntactic constructions involved.

This ends our general characterisation of how extensions are determined according to
material models.

Using the obvious correspondence with (12), (20) may then be completed to recapitu-
late the above analysis of (11), replacing possible worlds w with corresponding material
models M w and arriving at the following equation:
(21) |every boy fancies Mary and Jane pouts| M w
= ⊢Jane pouts in w⊣ × ⊢{x | x is a boy in w} ⊆ {y | y fancies Mary in w}⊣
(21) easily follows from [a completion of] (20). In fact, once the relevant inductive clauses
are adapted in the fashion illustrated above, equation (22a) holds quite generally, for any
expression A of a language L and any world w and material model M w ; and since (22a)
holds for all expressions A (of a given language L), then (22b) is true of all expressions
A and B (of the same language):
(22) a. |A| M w = ‖A‖ w
b. ‖A‖ w = ‖B‖ w iff |A| M w = |B| M w

In other words, two expressions are synonymous just in case their extensions coincide
across all material models. As a consequence, material models can also be used to charac-
terise sense relations in quite the same way as possible worlds were above. For instance,
a sentence S implies a sentence S' in the sense of the above definition just in case the
intension of the former is a subset of the latter, i.e. {w | ‖S‖ w = 1} ⊆ {w | ‖S'‖ w = 1}, which
by (22a) is the case iff {w | |S| M w = 1} ⊆ {w | |S'| M w = 1}. Similar arguments apply to the
other sense relations defined above.

Let us define the L-intension |A| of an expression A (of a language L) as the
function that assigns A’s extension (according to M w ) to each material model: |A|(M w )
= |A| M w , i.e. |A| = λM w . |A| M w . Observation (22) shows that L-intensions are as good as
intensions when it comes to determining extensions; and we have seen that they may
also be used to reconstruct sense relations defined via intensions, basically on account
of (22b). Moreover, the Boolean structure of the set of propositions expressible in L (=
those that happen to be the intensions of a sentence of L) turns out to be isomorphic to
the Boolean structure of L-propositions (= the L-intensions of the sentences of L): as
the patient reader may want to verify, the mapping from ‖S‖ w to |S| M w is one-one (injec-
tive) and preserves algebraic (Boolean) structure in that ‖S‖ w ⊆ ‖S'‖ w iff |S| M w ⊆ |S'| M w ,
‖S‖ w ∩ ‖S'‖ w = |S| M w ∩ |S'| M w , etc. The tight relation between Logical Space and the set
of material models can also be gleaned from considering worlds that cannot be distin-
guished by the expressions of a given language L:

Definition

If w and w' are possible worlds and L is a language, then w is L-indistinguishable
from w – in symbols: w ≡ L w' – iff ‖A‖ w = ‖A‖ w ', for any expression A of L.

In general, L-indistinguishability will not collapse into identity. The special case in which
it does, will be marked for future reference:

Definition

A language L is discriminative iff no two distinct possible worlds w and w' are
L-indistinguishable.

Hence, in a discriminative language L any two distinct possible worlds w and w', can be
distinguished by some expression A: ‖A‖ w ≠ ‖A‖ w ' ; it is not hard to see that in this case
the material models stand in a one-one correspondence with Logical Space. In particular,
if L contains a term the referent of which at a given world is that world itself, L will
certainly be discriminative; arguably, the definite description the world is such a term,
thus rendering English discriminative. In any case, for almost all languages L, any two
L-indistinguishable worlds give rise to the same material model:
(23) If w ≡ L w', then M w = M w' .

As a consequence, material models stand in a one-one correspondence to the equivalence
classes induced by L-indistinguishability (which is obviously an equivalence relation).

Since L-intensions and material models are suited to playing the role of worlds in
determining extensions and to characterising Boolean structure, one may wonder whether
they could replace worlds and intensions in general. In other words, is it possible to do
(extensional) semantics without Logical Space altogether? In particular, could meaning
be defined in terms of material models instead of possible worlds? Ontological thrift
seems to support this option: on the face of it, material models are rather down-to-earth
mathematical structures as compared to the dubious fi gments of imagination that
possible worlds may appear to the semantic layman. However, this impression is mis-
taken: though material models are mathematical structures, they consist of precisely the
stuff that possible worlds are made of, viz. fi ctional individuals under fi ctional circum-
stances. Still, replacing intensions with L-intensions may turn out to be, if not ontologi-
cally less extravagant, at least theoretically more parsimonious, sparing us a baroque
theory of Logical Space and its structure. However, this is not obvious either:
– So far material models have been defined in terms of Logical Space, since the exten-
sion a material model assigns to an expression A depends on details about w. If mate-
rial models are to replace worlds altogether, an independent characterisation for
them would have to be given. For instance, we have seen that no possible world sepa-
rates (9) from (10), particularly because there is no intensional difference between
woodchuck and groundhog. Hence these two nouns have the same L-intension: this
is a consequence of the above definition of a material model, relating it to the world
w on which it is based; it is reflected in the general equation (20iii). Now, if the very
notion of a material model is going to be defined independently of Logical Space,
then the coincidence of |woodchuck| M w and |groundhog| M w in all material models M w
would have to be guaranteed in some other way, without reference to the worlds these
models are based on. Hence some restriction to the effect that no model can assign
different extensions to the nouns under consideration would have to be formulated.

And even if in this particular case the restriction should appear unwelcome, there are
other cases in which similar restrictions are certainly needed – like the infamous inclu-
sion relation between the extensions of bachelor and unmarried. Arguably, at the end
of the day the restrictions to be imposed on the material models amount to a theory
of Logical Space; cf. Etchemendy (1990: 23f) for a similar point.
– Whereas Logical Space is absolute, material models are language-dependent. In par-
ticular (and disregarding neurotic cases), for any two distinct languages L and L', the
sets of material models of L and of L' will not overlap. Hence if material models were
to replace worlds in semantic theory, expressions from different languages would
always have different intensions. In particular, sentences would never be true under
the same circumstances, if circumstances corresponded to models. To make up for this
obvious inadequacy, some procedure for translating material models across languages
would be called for. For instance, a material model for English assigning a certain
set of individuals to the noun groundhog would have to be translated into a mate-
rial model for German assigning the same set to the noun Murmeltier. In general,
then, circumstances would correspond to equivalence classes of material models of
different languages. Obviously, at the end of the day the construction of these equiva-
lence classes again recapitulates the construction of Logical Space; presumably, a one-
one correspondence between material models and possible worlds requires an ideal
‘language’ of Logical Space, as envisaged by Wittgenstein (1922).

It thus appears that Logical Space can only be eliminated from (extensional) semantics
at the price of a theory of something very much like Logical Space. The upshot is that
neither ontological objectionability nor theoretical economy are suffi cient motives for
reversing the conceptual priority of Logical Space over the set of material models. On
the other hand, this does not mean that material models ought to be dispensed with. On
the contrary, they may be seen as compressions of possible worlds, reducing them to the
barest necessities of semantic analysis.
