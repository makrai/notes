# Abstract

* Model-theoretic semantics is a special form of truth-conditional semantics.
  * the truth-values of sentences depend on certain abstract objects, models.
  * models are mathematical structures that provide the interpretations of the
  * Originally designed for the semantic analysis of mathematical logic,
  * standard in linguistic semantics, mostly through the impact of R Montague
* frequently (and loosely) identified with possible worlds semantics, which
  rests on an identification of sentence meanings with regions in Logical
  Space, the class of all possible worlds. In fact, the two approaches have much
  in common and are not always easy to keep apart. In a sense,
  * model-theoretic semantics can be thought of as a restricted form/gen of
    possible worlds semantics
    * restricted: where models represent possible worlds; in
    * generalization: treating Logical Space as variable rather than given.
* we: an introductory exposition of model-theoretic semantics
  also covers possible worlds semantics – hopefully helping to disentangle the
  relationship between the two approaches.

# 1. Truth-conditional semantics

* motivation and background.
* tight connection between meaning and truth
* From a pre-theoretic point of view, linguistic meaning may appear a
  multi-faceted blend of phenomena, partly subjective and private, partly social
  and inter-subjective, mostly vague, slippery, and apparently hard to define
  * there are a few unshakable, yet substantial (non-tautological) insights into
  * differences in truth-value necessitate differences in meaning:
* meaning is primarily sentence meaning; for sentences are the bearers of truth,
* truth-conditional semantics, anything beyond this most marked trait of
  sentence meanings ought to be left out of consideration (or to pragmatics),
  * Wittgenstein (1922)
  * much of its flavour, as well as some of its problems, to this immediate
    consequence of the BP, to which we will return in section 2.
* The – common – identification of sentence meanings with truth conditions
  requires further motivation, which may be in functionalist considerations:
  * truth conditions suffice to explain the extralinguistic rôles attributed to
    sentence meaning in social interaction and cognitive processes. Though we
  * we will later see examples of covarying entities – the material models
    introduced in Section 2.3 – that are less likely to be identified with sen-
    tence meanings than truth conditions in the sense envisaged here. Bearing
* most radical form Frege (1884: 71)
  * derive the meanings of non-sentential expressions from sentence meanings
  * Without any further specification and constraints, this characterisation of
    nonsentential meaning is bound to be incomplete. To begin with,
  * the contribution an expression obviously depends on the position in which it occurs:
  * positions p can be identified with (certain) partial, injective functions
    on the domain of expressions, inserting occupants into hosts, so that an
    (occupant) expression A occurs in position p of a (host) expression B just
    in case p(A) = B. Positions in sentences are
  * these are structural positions that need not coincide with surface pos
  * in structurally ambiguous (surface) sentences depend on the latters’
    readings
  * can hardly be determined by looking at one sentence in isolation. Otherwise
  (1/2) Someone is buying/selling a car.
  * (1) and (2) have the same truth conditions and the same overall structure,
    * the verbs occupy the same position. Since the two sentences are otherwise
    * it would seem that the two verbs make the same contribution. If so, this
    * these verbs do differ in their truth-conditional contributions, as in:
      (3/4) Mary is buying/selling a car
* V's meanings can only be identified taking into account all positions in which
  * ie sameness of meaning among any non-sentential expressions A and B (of the
    same category) requires sameness of truth-conditional contribution
    throughout the structural positions of all sentences. Since A and B occupy
  * of the same category: not rule out the possibility that two expressions make
    the same truth-conditional contribution without being grammatically equiv.
    * Gazdar+ (1985: 32), _likely_ and _probable_ may be cases in point – given
* Subst leaves open what kinds of entities the meanings of non-sentential
  expressions are. Keeping the ‘minimalist’ spirit behind the passage from the
  * tempting to identify them by strengthening Subst to a bi-conditional,
  * hE, we will depart from radical truth-conditional semantics and not take it
    * counterexamples will be addressed in due course.
* various synonymous (non-sentential) expressions may be replaced simultaneously.
  * the meaning of any complex expression can be construed as only depending of
    the meanings of its immediate parts – thus giving rise to a famous
  * Principle of Compositionality [Compo]
  * may be A'=a, B'b, A''=b, B''=a, where '' is an alternative truth-conditional
    account
  * We will take a closer look at this argument in section 3.
* a particular concept of non-sentential meaning,
  some choices might be more natural than others. Indeed, Subst falls out
  * if the meaning of an expressions A is identified with
    the set of all expressions with which A can be replaced without any change
    in truth conditions, then Subst trivially holds. However,
  * hE, there is a serious problem with this strategy: if (non-sentential)
    * language-dependent. But if meanings were just substitution classes, then
    * change their meanings each time a new word is added to it!
    * This speaks against a construal of meanings in terms of abstraction,
    * even though synonymy classes have proved useful as representatives of
      meanings in the algebraic study of compositionality; cf.  Hodges (2001).
* criteria for deciding whether two expressions of different languages have
  the same meaning. Hence a substantial theory of nonsentential meaning cannot
  * finding a natural analogue to the MCP that goes beyond sentences. The most
  * If T 1 and T 2 are terms such that, under given circumstances, T 1 refers to
    something to which T 2 does not refer, then T 1 and T 2 differ in meaning.
  * term: an expression that may be said to refer to something.
  * Proper names, definite descriptions, and pronouns are cases in point. Thus,
    * in an email to Manfred Kupffer, I can use (iii) the _you_ to refer to him.
    * the two terms mentioned in the RPP must be understood as being used in the
      same context. Under different (past or counterfactual) circumstances, (ii)
      may refer to another person, or to no one at all; the RPP only mentions
  * For the purpose of this survey we will also assume that names with more than
    one bearer, like (i), are lexically ambiguous;
  * the terms in the RPP must therefore be taken as disambiguated expressions
* Why should the RPP be less certain than the MCP? One possible reason comes
  * ontology: referring terms is not necessarily clearly defined (Williams 2005)
  * whatever _terms_ may be, they must somehow determine their ref conditions,
    as depending on the circumstances.  According to a certain brand of truth-
    conditional semantics, anything beyond this most marked trait of term
    meanings ought to be left out of consideration (or to pragmatics), thus
* stronger version of our ‘minimalist’ semantic axiom:
  * any two terms agree in meaning => they agree in their reference
    conditions.
  * The common <= (called EBP) also requires further ‘external’ evidence.
  * Subst, the EBP may then be used to determine the meanings of at least some
    non-sentential expressions
    in a non-arbitrary and at the same time language-independent way, employing
    a heuristics based on:
* Frege’s Functional Principle [FFP]
  * If not specified by the EBP,
    the meaning of an expression A is the meaning of (certain) expressions in
    which A occurs as functionally depending on A’s occurrence.
  * ie the meaning of an expression A that is not a sentence or a term,
    is a function assigning meanings of host expressions (in which A occurs) to
    meanings of positions (in which A occurs) – where the latter can be made out
    in case the positions coincide with adjacent expressions whose meanings have
    been independently identified – either by the EBP, or by previous
    applications of the same strategy
  * e.g. the meanings of (coordinating) conjunctions C (like and and or) may be
    determined from their occurrences in unembedded coordinations of sentences A
    and B, i.e.  sentences of the form A C B; these occurrences are completely
  * simple predications of the form T P (where T is a term),
    the meanings of predicates P come out as functions
  * the result may in turn be used to obtain the meanings of transitive verbs V,
  * a large variety of expressions can be assigned meanings whose function is to
    contribute to truth and reference conditions without depending on any
    particular language
* Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons, following FFP this way does not settle
  the issue of determining meaning in a fully principled, non-arbitrary way: –
  * which of a given number of grammatical constructions ought to serve defi
    purpose above; and the choice may influence the meanings obtained by applying
  * Quantifier phrases – expressions like nobody; most linguists; every atom in
    * Customarily they are analyzed by putting them in subject position and thus
      * functions from predicate meanings (determined in the way above) to
        sentence meanings (determined by the EBP).
    * hW, they also occur in a host of other environments, e.g. as DOs. If the
      * would come out as functions from transitive verb meanings (determined in
        the way above) to predicate meanings (determined in the way above); and
    * if both environments were taken together, they would be
      functions defined on both predicate and verb meanings, etc.
    * Although there are one-one correspondences between these different constru
      * none of them can lay claim to being more natural than the others.  –
  * no guarantee that the meaning of an expression will behave compositionally
    beyond the primary occurrences chosen. For instance, it is well known that
    * eg the meaning of _and_ determined along the above lines, can be put to
      work in predicate coordinations such as sing and dance – basically due to
      the existence of corresponding clausal paraphrases of the form x sings and
      * not (or not so easily) adapted to cover ‘collective’ readings of
        coordinate proper names as in John and Mary are performing a duet.  –
  * the range of meanings covered by the primary occurrences of an expression
    may be restricted in various ways, sometimes by accidental gaps in the lex
    * eg the predicate meanings will depend on what terms there are, and what
  * in order to make the meanings thus determined general enough, their
    construction often crucially involves a certain amount of idealisation.
    * idealisations frequently go far beyond the inclusion of hard-to-describe
      objects as referents. As a result, the synonymy criterion mentioned above
* before FFP, trying to proceed in a bottom-up fashion, had encountered
  serious difficulties when it came to distinguishing the various modes of
  composing phrasal from lexical meanings. By changing the direction of
  * confined to (combinations of) content words, FFP
* FFP offers a much more differentiated picture of the varieties of meaning:
  combination mostly proceeds by functional application, and
  * make all expressions amenable to semantic analysis,
    including functional ones such as determiners and conjunctions.

## 2.1. Logical Space

* extension: the object that the meaning of an expression determines (for given
  circumstances, Carnap 1947). In other words, the extension
  * of a sentence is its truth value; and the extension
  * of a term is its referent. It is a remarkable fact that
  * the above strategy for determining meanings may be used to generalize the
    notion of extension to a wide range of expressions
  * the extension of an expression A as a function assigning
    extensions of host expressions ->
    extensions of positions in which A occurs.  We thus have what may be called
  * the Extensional Version of Frege’s Functional Principle
  * the extensions of coordinating conjunctions may be determined from their
  * the extensions of predicates come out as functions assigning truth values
    * characteristic functions of sets of individuals, i.e. functions from
  * in turn, transitive verbs come out as curried binary relations,
    i.e.  functions assigning characteristic functions to individuals (= the
    * the curried version of R assigns the characteristic
      function of {y∈U | (y, x)∈R} to any individual x∈U. It is not hard to see
  * the extensions of quantifier phrases can be identified as (character-
    istic functions of) sets of predicate extensions; and
    * once nouns are regarded as synonymous with predicates,
    the extensions of determiners: (curried) relations among predicate exts.
  * extension of
    everybody = supersets of the set of all persons; the extension of
    no = the relation of disjointness among sets of individuals; etc. Since
  * 1 is crucial because 2
    * this generalisation of predicate extensions to functions operating on
      arbitrary individuals
    * the truth value of a sentence with a quantifier in subject position may
      depend on the value of the predicate extension for nameless individuals,
* this extensional adaptation is much more limited in its application than FFP
  * it only works as long as extensions behave compositionally; otherwise it is
  * and there are a number of environments that cannot be analyzed by
    compositionally combining extensions. Still, a considerable portion of the
* truth conditions and reference conditions (in the sense intended here): since
  * functions assigning truth values to referents as depending on circumstances
  * presupposes that, whatever circumstances form a set that may serve as dom
  * the set of circumstances is
    * vast, and that Circumstances may be as hypothetical as can be.
    * its members do not miss a detail: Circumstances are as specific as can be.
* Vastness reflects the raison d’être of circumstances in semantic theory:
  * circumstances serve to differentiate the meanings of non-synonymous
    sentences and terms by providing them with distinct truth values and
    referents, respectively. In order to fulfill this task in an adequate way,
  * actual circumstances – those met in the actual world – obviously do not
    suffice, as a random example shows:
    (5) The physicist who discovered the X-rays died in Munich.
    (6) The first Nobel laureate in physics died in Munich.
    * it so happens that the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered a
      phenomenon known as X-rays in 1895, was subsequently awarded the first
      Nobel prize in physics in 1901, and died in Munich in 1923. Hence the
    * subjects refer to the same person, and both are true
    * hE, not synonymous, and neither are the definite descriptions in their
      subject position. In order to reflect these semantic differences in their
    * circumstances are called for under which (5) and (6) differ in truth
      value and, consequently, their subjects do not corefer. Such
  * it is hardly foreseeable what kinds of differences are needed in order to
    separate two non-synonymous sentences or terms by circumstances under which
    their extensions do not coincide, we will assume that
    any conceivable circumstances count as evidence for non-synonymy,
    however far-fetched or bizarre they may be. The following pair, inspired by
* Macbeath (1982), is a case in point:
  (7) Dr Who ate himself.
  (8) Dr Who is his own father.
  * there better be circumstances that contradict current science, thereby
* The point of Detail is that counterfactual (= non-actual) circumstances are
  just as specific. Hence if I had been on a space shuttle instead of riding a
* ordinary conception of worlds of imagination or fiction: stories and novels
  usually, nay always, leave open a lot of details – like the exact number of

  * elements of Logical Space as possible worlds rather than circumstances,
  * it will be left open here whether possible worlds are all-inclusive
    agglomerations of facts, or whether they could also correspond to more
    mundane, medium-sized situations. What is important is that Logical Space
* cannot guarantee that any two sentences that appear to differ in meaning also
  differ in their truth conditions. Thus, e.g., (9)–(10) are true of precisely

       or he does not live in Georgia.

    (12b) and (12c) have been suppressed and may be thought of as being
* their extensions can be derived by functional application

## 2.2. Material models 12

* in order to specify the extensions of arbitrary (extensional) expressions,spc
  a. the extensions of all (extensional) lexical expressions and
  b. the way the (extensional) grammatical constructions combine them.
* If these constructions constitute the primary contexts of expressions
  analyzed in terms of (the extensional version of FFP),
  (b) is always a matter of functional application
* Other (extensional) constructions may require some ingenuity
  to determine the precise way in which extensions combine.
  * Quantified objects are an infamous case in point
  * the extension of a predicate of the form V Q, where V is transitive verb
    and Q is a quantifier phrase (in direct object position), can be given by
    the following equation: (15) ‖V Q‖^w = λx. ‖Q‖^w (λy. ‖V‖^w (y)(x))
  * extensional constructions = the extensions of the expressions they combine
    determine the extensions of the resulting phrases, thus giving rise to
* (b) does not depend on the particular circumstances envisaged
* ie the world dependence of extensions is just a matter of lexical spec (a)
  * the rôle worlds play in the determination of extensions restricted to the
    extensions of lexical expressions – the rest is compositionality, captured
    by general equations like (14) and (15)]
  * possible worlds could be identifi ed with functions assigning extensions to
    lexical expressions.
  If A is a lexical expression, we would thus have:
* (16) ‖A‖^w = F w (A)
  * F w is a function assigning to any expression in its domain the extension
    of that expression at world w
  * What is the domain of F w ? It has just been noted that
    * it only contains lexical expressions – but does it include all of them? A
    * eg the extension of a (sentence-) coordinating conjunction _and_ is
    (17) a. ‖and‖^w = λu. λv. u × v b. ‖or‖^w = λu. λv. (u + v) – (u × v) c not
  * the specifications of the world-dependent extensions of lexical expressions
    may safely skip such logical words. A similar case can be made for
  * quantificational determiners and the _is_ of identity: (18) a. ‖every‖^w = λP.
    (18)  a. ‖every‖^w = λP. λQ. ⊢P ⊆ Q⊣
          b. ‖no‖^w = λP. λQ. ⊢P ∩ Q = ∅⊣
          c. ‖is‖^w = λx. λy. ⊢x = y⊣
* in (18) ‘x’ and ‘y’ stand for individuals and ‘P’ and ‘Q’ for
* which, and how many, individuals there are, depends on the particular world w.
  so do the equations in (18)
  * only depend on what the set of all individuals in the world w is.  In other
  * not depend on the particularities of the world but (at most) on the domain
    of individuals. In this respect, logical words as analyzed
* the extensions of the vast majority of lexical expressions do vary across
  (19) ‖boy‖^w = λx. ⊢x is a boy in w⊣ [= (12b)]
* thus three kinds of lexical expressions:
  * truth-functional ones, whose extension remains the very same across worlds
  * combinatorial ones, whose extension depends only on the domain of indivs
  * non-logical ones, whose extensions may depend on all sorts of worldly facts
* the material model (for L based on w) is the pair M w = (U w ,F w )
  * the domain of individuals U w in w and
  * the lexical interpretation function F w which assigns to every non-logical
    lexical expression A of L the extension of A at w.
* presupposing a prior and independent specification of the non-logical
  vocabulary N L of the language L under
  * implies that the interpretation functions of any two material models share
    their domain, which is precisely the set N L . It should then be clear how
* the extensions of arbitrary expressions A of a language L can be characterised
  in the form of an inductive definition, which
  starts out with the lexical material and then
  moves on step by step, following the grammatical construction principles of L,
  which derive (analysed and disambiguated) complex expressions from their
  (immediate) parts, thereby creating an increase in syntactic complexity. The
* semantic characterisation of logical words
  * We have already seen that one characteristic feature of logical words is
    that their extension is largely world-independent
  * hE the intensions of proper names as constant functions over Logical Space
    * Kripke (1972): terms with constant intensions are called rigid designator
  * intuition that the extension of a logical word can be described in purely
    structural terms
  * functions as configurations of arrows leading from arguments
  * the extension of a logical word can be described solely in terms of the
    abstract arrangement of these arrows,
    without mentioning any particular individuals or other extensions – apart
    from the truth values
  * not depend on the identity of the individuals, which may be replaced by othe
  * logical words as having extensions that are stable under any replacement of
    individuals
  * type notation
    * classify the extensions of expressions according to whether they derive
      (i) from the EBP, or
      * the extensions of sentences/terms are said to be of type t and e
      (ii) by application of FFP:
      * if the extension of an expression
        operates on extensions of some type `a`
        resulting in extensions of some type b, it is said to be of type (a,b).
* expressions' types remain the same throughout Logical Space
  * the type assignment of L: τ L assigning to each expression of a language L
    the unique type of its extensions
  * part of the specification of the language L
* replacement
  * Given (not necessarily distinct) possible worlds w and w',
    a replacement (of w by w') is
    a bijective function from the domain of individuals of w to that of w'
  * may then be generalized from individuals (of type e) to all types of
    extensions: given a replacement ρ (from w to w'), the following recursive
    equations define corresponding functions ρ a , for each type a:
  * ρ e = ρ;
  * ρ t = { (0,0),(1,1)} = λx. x, where ‘x’ ranges over truth values
  * ρ (a,b) = λf. {(ρ a (x), ρ b (y)| f(x) = y}
      [where ‘f’ ranges over functions of type (a,b)]
* ρ a is the identical mapping on the extensions of type `a` if (and only if) ρ
  is the identical mapping on the domain of individuals.
* a logical word A can be defined as one
  whose extensions cannot be affected by replacements.
  More precisely, if ƒ is an intension of type a (i.e. a function from W to
  extensions of type a),
  then ƒ is (replacement-)invariant just in case for any replacements ρ and ρ'
  of w by some world w', it holds that ρ α (f (w)) = ρ' α (f (w))
* logical words may then be characterised as lexical expressions A with
  invariant intensions: ρ τ(A) (‖A‖^w ) = ρ' τ(A) (‖A‖^w ),
  for any worlds w and replacements ρ and ρ' of w by some world w'.
* implies that `ρ_{τ(A)} (‖A‖^w ) = ‖A‖^w`, whenever A is a logical word and ρ
  is a replacement from a world w to itself (or any world with the same domain
  of individuals) – which is
  * a classical criterion of logicality (Lindenbaum & Tarski 1935)
* Extensive treatments of replacements in (models of) Logical Space can be found
  in Fine (1977) and Rabinowicz (1979).
* we will also call extensions of types `a` invariant if they happen to be the
  values of invariant intensions of type `a`
* Invariant extensions are always of a peculiar, combinatorial kind. In
  * ignoring all too small universes (of cardinalities 1 and 2),
  * extensions of type e are never invariant;
  * only two invariant extensions of type (e,t), viz. the empty one and the
  * four of type (e,(e,t)), viz.  identity, distinctness, and the two trivial
    (empty and universal) binary relations;
  * extensions of type ((e,t),t) are invariant just in case they classify sets
    of individuals according to their cardinalities; etc. As a consequence,
* it takes more for an intension to be invariant than just having invar ext; in
  * a function that assigns different invariant extensions to worlds with the
     same domain cannot be invariant
  * if the domains U and U' of two material models M and M' have the same
     cardinality, the invariance condition on logical words of the second kind
     (ii eg every) ensure that, intuitively speaking, they have analogous extensions.
     Thus, e.g., a determiner whose extension relative to M is the
     subset-relation on U will denote the subset on U' in M'.
* hE, if U and U' have different cardinalities, logicality does not exclude that
  the extension varies (eg, subsethood on U and disjointness on U')
  * no generally agreed identification procedure of extensions across varying
    domains to exclude such cardinality-sensitive shift
    (Machover (1994); Casanovas (2007))
  * We will briefly return to this point in Section 3.1.
* all extensions specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of (20) are indeed invariant.
  * the combinations specified in clause (iv) are invariant once they are
    themselves construed as extensions: the compositional combination of
    extensions generally proceeds by way of purely structural operations,
    corresponding to invariant functional extensions. The reader is reminded
    that we restrict attention to extensional constructions;
    * non-extensional compositionality will be addressed in the following section.
* The gaps in (20), then, are meant to be filled in as follows
  * The extensions of truth-functional logical words, i.e. those whose type
    consists of ts, commas, and brackets only, are specified in clause (i); and
    * independent of any particular world. The extensions of
  * all other logical words (which, for lack of a better term, we continue to
    call combinatorial) are specified in clause (ii); their
    * intensions are invariant, and their extensions in general depend on the
      domain of individuals
  * the ways in which the extensions of complex expressions depend on the
    extensions of their immediate parts, correspond to invariant (and
    generally domain-dependent) functional extensions and are specified in
    clause (iv), according to the syntactic constructions involved.
* (20) may then be completed to recapitulate the above analysis of (11),
  replacing possible worlds w with corresponding material models M w and
  (21) |every boy fancies Mary and Jane pouts| M w = ⊢Jane pouts in w⊣ ×
        ⊢{x | x is a boy in w} ⊆ {y | y fancies Mary in w}⊣
(22)  a. |A| M w = ‖A‖^w
      b. ‖A‖^w = ‖B‖^w iff |A| M w = |B| M w
* ie two expressions are synonymous just in case their extensions coincide
  across all material models
  * material models can also be used to characterise sense relations in quite
    the same way as possible worlds were above.
  * eg a sentence S implies a sentence S' in the sense of the above definition
    just in case the intension of the former is a subset of the latter, i.e. {w
* define the L-intension |A| of an expression A (of a language L) as the
  function that assigns A’s extension (according to M w ) to each material
  model: |A|(M w ) = |A| M w , i.e. |A| = λM w . |A| M w . Observation (22)
  shows that L-intensions are as good as intensions when it comes to determining
  extensions; and we have seen that they may also be used to reconstruct sense
  relations defined via intensions, basically on account of (22b). Moreover, the
  Boolean structure of the set of propositions expressible in L (= those that
  happen to be the intensions of a sentence of L) turns out to be isomorphic to
  the Boolean structure of L-propositions (= the L-intensions of the sentences
  of L): as the patient reader may want to verify, the mapping from ‖S‖^w to |S|
  M w is one-one (injective) and preserves algebraic (Boolean) structure in
  that ‖S‖^w ⊆ ‖S'‖^w iff |S| M w ⊆ |S'| M w , ‖S‖^w ∩ ‖S'‖^w = |S| M w ∩ |S'| M
  w , etc. The tight relation between Logical Space and the set of material
  models can also be gleaned from considering worlds that cannot be distin-
  guished by the expressions of a given language L:
* def L-indistinguishable w ≡ L w'
  * If w and w' are possible worlds and L is a language, then
    w is L-indistinguishable from w iff ‖A‖^w = ‖A‖^w', for any expression A of L.
* L is discriminative iff no two distinct possible worlds w and w' are
  L-indistinguishable.
  * in this case the material models stand in a one-one correspondence with
    Logical Space
  * In particular, if L contains a term the referent of which at a given world
    is that world itself, L will certainly be discriminative;
  * arguably, the definite description _the world_ is such a term, thus
    rendering English discriminative
  * for almost all languages L, any two L-indistinguishable worlds give rise to
    the same material model: (23) If w ≡ L w', then M w = M w' .
* material models stand in a one-one correspondence to the
  equivalence classes induced by L-indistinguishability
* whether they could replace worlds and intensions in general. In other words,
  * could meaning be defined in terms of material models instead of possible ws?
  * hE, material models have been defined in terms of Logical Space
  * if the very notion of a material model is going to be defined independently
    of Logical Space, then the coincidence of |woodchuck| M w and |groundhog| M
    w in all material models M w would have to be guaranteed in some other way,
  * there are other cases in which similar restrictions are certainly needed –
    like the infamous inclusion relation between the extensions of bachelor
    and unmarried
  * Arguably, at the end of the day the restrictions to be imposed on the
    material models amount to a theory of Logical Space; cf.  Etchemendy (1990)
  * material models are language-dependent. In particular (and
  * disregarding neurotic cases, for any two distinct languages L and L', the
    sets of material models of L and of L' will not overlap.
    * languages would always have different intensions. In particular, sentences
    * translating material models across languages would be called for. For
      * a material model for English assigning a certain set of individuals to
        the noun groundhog would have to be translated into a material model for
        German assigning the
    * then, circumstances would correspond to equivalence classes of material
      models of different languages
    * a oneone correspondence between material models and possible worlds
      requires an ideal ‘language’ of Logical Space, as envisaged by
      Wittgenstein (1922).
  * sum: neither ontological objectionability nor theoretical economy are
    sufficient motives for
    reversing the conceptual priority of Logical Space over the set of mater mod
  * material models may be seen as compressions of possible worlds, reducing
    them to the barest necessities of semantic analysis.

## 2.3. Intensionality 20

* The adaptation of FFP to derive extensions for expressions other than
  sentences and terms
  only works in so-called __extensional contexts__,
  i.e.  (syntactic) constructions in which extensionally equivalent parts may
  replace each other without affecting the extension of the host expression.
  However, a number of environments prove to be non-extensional.
* Clausal complements to attitude verbs like think and know are classical cases
  * their contribution to the extension of the predicate cannot be their own
    extension which is merely a truth value; if it were, materially equivalent
    (24) John thinks Mary is home.
    (25) John thinks Ann is pregnant.
* blocks the derivation of the extension of _think_ via the extensional version
  of FFP: if it were a function ƒ assigning the predicate extension to the
  * not show that attitude verbs do not have extensions,
    nor that FFP cannot be used to determine them
  * V's contribution
    * must consist in more than a truth value
    * is the intension of the complement clause; cf. Frege (1892)
  * any two intensionally equivalent sentences
    are synonymous and
    may thus replace each other in any (sentential) position – including
    non-extensional ones – with out affecting the truth conditions of the host
  * In particular, _T thinks S_ and _T thinks S'_ (where T is a term) will be
    synonymous if the sentences S and S' have the same intension. But
    * then at any possible world, the extensions of the predicates _thinks S_
      and _thinks S'_ coincide, and thus so do their intensions. In other words,
    * there can be no difference in the extensions of the predicates without a
      difference in the intensions of the complement clauses, which is to say
    * think of the intensions of the embedded clauses as the contributions they
      make to the extension of the predicate and thus take the
      extension of the attitude verb to be the function that assigns the
      extension of the host predicate to this contribution.
* the extension of _thinks_ comes out as a function that assigns sets of
  individuals to sets of possible worlds such that the following equation holds:
  (27) ‖thinks‖^w (‖S‖)(‖T‖^w ) = ‖T thinks S‖^w
* requires a richer system of types than extensional types). More
  specifically, the extensions of expressions are classifi ed according to
  whether they derive
  * from the EBP, or
    * the extensions of sentences of type t, those of terms are of type e
  * by application of FFP:
    * if the extensions of an expression operates on extensions of some type `a`
      resulting in extensions of some type `b`, it is of type (a,b)
    * it is of type ((s,a), b)
      if it operates on intensions of expressions whose extensions are of type
      `a`, resulting in extensions of type `b`.
* Hence
  * t is the type of truth values
  * e is the type of individuals (or entities)
  * (a,b) is the type of (total) functions from a to b
  * and (s,a) is the type of (total) functions from Logical Space to a. The
* notation from Montague (1970)
  * ‘s’ is reminiscent of sense, Frege’s (1892) term for intension. In this
* the extension of an attitude verb like think is of type ((s,t),(e,t)).
* Compositional derivations can again be simulated with material models in lieu
  of worlds, as in the case of extensional constructions
  * this only requires models to
    * also assign extensions of intensional types containing ‘s’ to certain
      lexical expressions (like attitude verbs) and to
    * allow the extensions of complex operations to be obtained by combining the
      extensions and/or intensions of their immediate parts.
* the recursive procedure for determining extensions relative to material models
  of Ê may also contain clauses like the following,
  * where Ê is a more inclusive fragment of English than E:
  (iv-c) |V S| M w = |V| M w (λw'. |S| M w' ) if V S is a predicate,
  where V is an attitude verb and S is a clausal complement
* the programme of eliminating Logical Space in favour of the set of material
  models cannot be upheld beyond the realm of extensional constructions.
  * For, unlike the intension of the embedded clause, λw'. |S| M w |S| M w',
    the corresponding L-intension, λM w'. |S| M w' , cannot serve as an
    argument to the extension |V| M w of the attitude verb: the latter is the
    value of a lexical extension assignment F w , which itself is a component of
    M w , which in turn is a member of the domain of λ M w '. |S| M w' – which
    cannot be, for set-theoretic reasons.
* the intension of the embedded clause is defined in terms of its extensions
  relative to all other material models. While this does not present any
  * this makes the material models less self-contained than their extensional
    counterparts, which contain all the information needed to determine the
    extensions of all expressions
  * this seeming defect can be remedied:
* Given a possible world w_ and a language L, the __intensional material model__
  (for L based on w_) is the quadruple M̂ w* = (W, Û, w*, F̂ ) con sist ing of the
  * set W of all possible worlds; the
  * domain function Û assigning to each possible world w the domain of
    individuals U w ;
  * the world `w*` itself; and
  * the lexical interpretation function F̂  which assigns to every non-logical
    lexical expression A of L the intension of A at w.
* Two complications arising from this definition are worth noting:
  * Universal and existential quantification over possible worlds are prime
    candidates for logical operations of type ((s,t),t), the former yielding the
    truth value 1 only if applied to Logical Space itself, whereas the latter is
    true of all but the empty set of possible worlds. Since the extensions of
    lexical expressions need not be of extensional types, the logicality border
    needs some adjustment. For the time being we will leave this matter open,
    returning to it in Section 3.2 with a natural extension of the replacement
    approach to logicality.
  * Lest clauses like (iv-c) should make reference to anything outside the
    intensional model, the lexical interpretation function is defined for all
    worlds w. As a consequence, two distinct intensional material models only
    differ in their 3rd component, and each determines the extensions of all
    expressions at all possible worlds. Hence the procedure for determining the
    extensions is more general than expected; its precise format will also be
    given in Section 3.2.
* Intensional material models are rather redundant objects, which is why they
  * not used in real-life semantics; we have mainly defined them here for future
  * set theory precludes Logical Space as it appears in them, from being
    replaced by the set of all intensional material models. On the other hand,
    its rôle might be played by the set of extensional material models, i.e.
    those that only cover the extensional part of L – containing only its
    lexical expressions with extensions of extensional types, and its
    extensional syntactic constructions.

# 3 Model-theoretic semantics 23

* as a providing a mathematical reconstruction of possible worlds semantics,
  ultimately arriving at the more abstract perspective: model is gen of possible

## 3.1. Extensional model space

* replace the individuals by (arbitrary) set-theoretic objects
  * by a straightforward generalisation of the replacements used above
  * the individuals to be replaced also function as the building blocks of
    extensions, the latter will have to be generalised first
* Given any non-empty set U, the U-extensions of type e are the elements of U;
  the U-extensions of type t are the truth values; and
  if a and b are extensional types, then the U-extensions of type (a,b) are the
  (total) functions from U-extensions of type `a` to U-extensions of type b.
* U-extensions (of extensional types) : the elements of U ::
  ordinary extensions : the individuals of a given possible world
  * ordinary extensions = `U_w`-extensions, where `U_w` is the domain of indivs
* Given a language L, a __formal model__ (for L) is a pair M = (U, F)
  * non-empty set U (= the universe of M) and a
  * function F which assigns to every non-logical lexical expression A of L a
    U-extension of type τ L (A).
* Using the recursive procedure applied earlier,
  we can extend any bijection ρ between any (not necessarily distinct)
  non-empty sets U and Ũ of the same cardinality,
  to a family of functions ρ a taking U-extensions to corresponding
  Ũ-extensions (where a is an extensional type):
  * ρ e = ρ
  * ρ t (x) = x, if x is a truth value
  * and ρ b ( f (x)) = ρ (a, b) (f)(ρ a (x)), whenever f and x are U-extensions
    of types (a,b) and a, respectively. It is readily verified that
    replacements assign structural analogues to the U-extensions they are
    applied to. For instance, if f is a U-extension of some type a, then ρ
    (a,t) (f) is (i.e., characterises) the set of all Ũ-extensions of the form
    ρ a (x), where x is a U-extension of type a; in particular, and given that
    ρ a is a bijection, f and ρ (a,t) (f ) are of the same cardinality. It is
    also worth noticing that the values of invariant extensions are themselves
    invariant, in an obvious sense:

Observations

Let U w be the domain of individuals of some world w, X an invariant U w -
extension of some type a, and ρ a bijection from U w to a set U of the same
cardinality. Then:
`(*)` ρ' a (X) = ρ" a (ρ a (X)), for any bijections ρ' and ρ" from U w and U to some set

U' of the same cardinality, respectively;
(**) ρ a (X) = ρ' a (X), for any bijection ρ' from U w to U.

The proofs of (*) and (**) are rather straightforward and thus left to the readers.






785

* Generalised replacements may now be put to use to
  substitute material models by structurally identical set-theoretic objects.
  If M = (U, F) and M̃ = ( U % , F % ) are formal models, a bijection ρ from U
  to Ũ is called a model-isomorphism (from M to M̃ ) just in case F̃ (A) = ρ τ(A)
  (F(A)), whenever A∈N L . If there exists a model-isomorphism from M to M̃, M
  is said to be isomorphic to M̃ – in symbols: M ≅ M̃. Obviously this relational
  concept is reflexive as well as symmetric and transitive. Clearly, even if
  two models are isomorphic, not every bijection between their domains is an
  isomorphism; but in general there exists more than one isomorphism between
  them.

Given a formal model M = (U,F) and any bijection ρ from U to a set U* of the
same cardinality, there exists a formal model M* = (U*, F*) such that ρ is a model-
isomorphism from M to M* (and thus M ≅ M*): M* can be constructed by putting:

F*(A) : = ρ τ(A) (F(A)), whenever A ∈ N L . Hence given a material model M w = (U w , F w ),
an isomorphic formal model M = (U, F) can be constructed from any set U of the same
cardinality as U w , by choosing an arbitrary bijection ρ from U w to U. In this case M is
said to represent M w . It should be noted that, if U = U w , the resulting formal model need
not be a material model, because the structure imposed on its individuals may go against
their very nature. For example, if U happens to contain the world w itself, then replacing it
with Tom, Dick or Harry could put w in the extension of bachelor, which may be not be a
genuine possibility for a world to be.

If a material model for a language L is represented by a formal model, the recursive
procedure for determining extensions of arbitrary expressions relative to the former
carries over to the latter:
(30) If ρ is a model-isomorphism from the material model M w = (U w , F w ) (of a language

L) to the formal model M = (U, F), then the extension [[A]] M of an expression A is
determined by the following induction on A’s complexity:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
[[A]] M = |A| M w [= ||A|| w ], if A is a truth-functional lexical item;
[[A]] M = ρ τ(A) (|A|) M w ), if A is a combinatorial lexical item;
[[A]] M = F(A) [= ρ τ(A) (F w (A))], if A ∈ N L ;
[[A]] M = ρ τ(A) (G(ρ – τ 1 (B ) ([[B 1 ]] M ),..., ρ – τ 1 (B n ) ([[B n ]] M ))), if A is a complex expression
1
with immediate constituents B 1 ,..., B n such that |A| M w = G(|B 1 | M w ,...,|B n | M w ).

The fi nal clause relates to the compositional interpretation of L in terms of invariant
functions that combine the extensions of the parts of complex expressions. In general,
these semantic operations cannot be gleaned from the material models M w or the exten-
sions |A| M w determined relative to them; rather, they must be specified independently, as
was done above for an extensional fragment of English. Given such a specification, the
extensions defined in (30) turn out to be independent of ρ; the verification of this fact –
which essentially turns on the above observation (**) on invariance – is left to the reader.

The following observation about isomorphic formal models M and M̃ (for any
language L) is fundamental to model-theoretic semantics:
(31) Let ρ be a model isomorphism from M to M̃. Then
for all expressions A of L, ρ τ(A) ([[A]] M ) = [[A]] M̃. .
(31) follows from (30) by a straightforward inductive argument; clause (iv) makes use of
the above observation (**) on invariance. The special case of (31) where M = M̃ = M w








(for some world w) and ρ is the identical mapping on U w , reveals that, as far as mate-
rial models are concerned, the extensions defined in (30) are the familiar ones (and still
independent of ρ):
(32) If M w is a material model for a language L and A is an expression of L, then
cf. Section 2.2, (22a)
[[A]] M w = |A| M w = ||A|| w .

Another immediate consequence of (31) concerns (declarative) sentences S (of a given
language L), for which τ L (S) = t and hence ρ τ(S) ([[S]] M ) = [[S]] M :
(33) If the formal model M (for a language L) represents the material model M w , then
[[S]] M = [[S]] M w ,
for all sentences S of L.

* the set-theoretic reconstruction of Logical Space, to which we now turn. As
  * we will refer to
    * those objects that may occur as elements of sets without being sets
      themselves, as urelements; and to
    * sets that can be constructed without the aid of urelements (and whose
      existence is thus guaranteed by set-theoretic principles alone) as pure
      sets. In view of ontological reservations against possible worlds, such
      pure sets ought to replace the universes of models:

Definition

If L is a language, then (L’s) Ersatz Space is the class of all formal models M
= (U, F) of L such that U is a pure set and M represents a material model.

* the elements of L’s Ersatz Space = ersatz models (for L).

Since the inventory of Logical Space consists of urelements, no material model is an
ersatz model. On the other hand, every material model is represented by some ersatz
model and thus makes a vicarious appearance in Ersatz Space, which is why the latter as
a whole may be seen as a representation of Logical Space. It should also be noted that,
according to our definitions, the material models and the ersatz models do not exhaust
the class of all formal models for a language; and that merely having a pure set as its
universe does not make a formal model an ersatz model.

* Ersatz Space is far too big to form a set and therefore
  calls for a background theory that includes proper classes alongside ordinary
  sets; Cf.  Mendelson (1997: 225ff) for a survey of a pertinent set-theo framw
* we have been assuming that Logical Space (as we characterised it) is a set,
  => one cannot expect the ersatz models (for a given language L) to stand in a
  one-one correspondence with possible worlds or material models. However,
* the construction of Ersatz Space via representation suggests that
  the objects corresponding to worlds or material models are
  the ersatz models' isomorphicity-classes,
  i.e. the (proper) classes of the form:
  (34) |M 0 | ≅ : = {M | M is an ersatz model for L & M ≅ M 0 },
  where M 0 is an ersatz model for L. It is therefore natural to inquire into
* the relation between
  the classes characterised in (34) and the members of Logical Space. We have
  * the latter may be represented by material models, and that
    * this representation is a perfect match if the language L is discriminativ
  However, even if the material models correspond to the possible worlds in a
  one-one fashion, there is no guarantee that so do the classes of ersatz
  models in (34). More precisely,
  even if (35) holds of any worlds w and w' and the corresponding material
  models M w and M w'
  the analogous implication (36) about the latter and their representations in
  Ersatz Space need not be true:
(35) If w ≠ w', then M w ≠ M w .
(36) If M w ≠ M w' then |M w | ≅ ≠ |M w' | ≅

* ie distinct material models may be represented by the same ersatz models
  iff L allows for distinct, but isomorphic material models in the first place.
  Discriminativity does not exclude this possibility: it only implies some
extensional differences between any two material models; but these differences could be
made up for by the replacements used in representing material models in Ersatz Space.
* In order to guarantee a perfect match between Logical Space and Ersatz Space,
  a stronger condition on L is needed than discriminativity. The natural
* completeness, w ≈ L w', which is defined like discriminativity, except
  * If w and w' are possible worlds and L is a language, then
    w is L-equivalent to w' iff ‖S‖ w = ‖S‖ w' , for any declarative sentence S
  * iff no two distinct possible worlds w and w' are L-equivalent.
  * not affected by replacements in that it
    only concerns the truth values of sentences
    rather than the extensions of arbitrary expressions.
(37) a. If w ≡ L w', then w ≈ L w'.
  b. If L is complete, then L is discriminative.
  c. If L is complete and w ≠ w', then |M w | ≅ ≠ |M w' | ≅
    * ie via the isomorphicity classes, the Ersatz Space of a complete language
      matches Logical Space.
* => completeness plays a similar rôle for the adequacy of ersatz models as
  does discriminativity in the case of material models.
  * However, whereas discriminative languages are easy to find,
    completeness seems a much rarer property. Of course, if a language is
    incomplete, its
    ersatz models could still match Logical Space in the sense of (37a), but
    then again their isomorphicity classes may equally well contain, and thus
    conflate, representations of distinct worlds. However, since the
    differences between distinct worlds that correspond to the same ersatz
    models are – by definition – inexpressible in the language under
    investigation, this imperfect match
between Logical Space and Ersatz Space does not necessarily conflict with the general
programme of replacing possible worlds with formal models. As far as its potential in
descriptive semantics goes, then, Ersatz Space does seem to earn its name. However,
as the reader will have noticed, its very definition still appears to be of no avail when
it comes to soothing ontological worries: by employing the concept of representation,
it depends on material models – and thus presupposes Logical Space. To overcome this
* a definition of Ersatz Space is needed that does not rely on Logical Space.
  The usual strategy is one of approximation,
  starting out from a maximally wide model space and
  gradually restricting it by eliminating those formal models that do not
  represent any material counterparts; the crucial point is that these
  restrictions be formulated without reference to Logical Space, i.e. in the
  language of pure set theory, or with reference only to urelements that are
  less dubious than the inhabitants of Logical Space. We will refer to the
  natural starting point of this enterprise as L’s Model Space,
and identify it with the class of all pure models (for a given language L), i.e. all formal
models whose universe is a pure set. It should be noted that
* the concept of a pure model only depends on L’s syntax and type assignment,
  both of which in principle may be given in terms of pure set theory.

In order to exploit Model Space for semantic purposes, the procedure for determining
the extensions of expressions must be generalised from ersatz models to arbitrary pure
models. Hence, for any pure model M = (U, F), the extensions of logical expressions
need to be specified, as well as the combinations of extensions corresponding to the
syntactic constructions. As in the case of Logical Space and Ersatz Space, this should not
pose any particular problems. In fact, these extensions and combinations are invariant
and should only depend on the universe U. Thus, for those U that happen to be of the
same cardinality as the universe U w of some material model M w = (U w , F w ), their specifi-
cations may be taken over from Ersatz Space that is bound to contain at least some pure
model with universe U (and isomorphic to M w ). For all other models they would have
to be suitably generalised. Thus, e.g., it is natural to define the extension of the English
determiner _every_ as characterising the subset relation on a given universe U, even if
the latter is larger than any of the universes U w encountered in Logical Space; similarly,
the extension of a quantifier phrase D N, where D is a determiner and N a count noun,
can be determined by functional application – which, suitably restricted, is an invariant
U-extension of type ((e,t),t),(e,t); etc.

At the end of the day, then, the formal models resemble their material and ersatz
counterparts. In particular, the specification of extensions is strikingly similar:
(38) For any expression A of E and any formal model M = (U, F) for E,
  the extension of A relative to M – [[A]] M – is determined by the following
  induction (on the grammatical complexity of A):
(i-a) [[and]] M = λu. λv. u × v
...
...
... where u∈{0, 1} and v∈{0, 1}
(ii-a) [[every]] M = λP. λQ. ⊢P ⊆ Q⊣
...
...
where P⊆U and Q⊆U
(iii) [[A]] M = F w (A), if A∈N E
(iv-a) [[D N ]] M = [[D]] M ([[N]] M )
  if D N is a quantifier phrase, where D is a quantificational determiner and N
  is a count noun;
... ...

Given specifications of extensions in the style (38), one may start approximating the
Ersatz Space of a language L by restricting its Model Space. A common strategy to this
* eliminate models that have certain sentences come out false, viz. analytic
  sentences that owe their truth to their very meaning. As a case in point,
  one may require of
appropriate models for English that the extension of (39) be the truth value 1. For the
sake of the example it may be assumed that the extension of a predicative adjective is a
set of individuals and that it is passed on to the predicate (Copula + Adjective); cf. Heim
& Kratzer (1998: 61ff).
(39) No bachelor is married.

More generally, a set Σ of sentences of L may be used to characterise the class of all pure
models M (for L) such that [[S]] M = 1, for all S∈Σ
* Carnap (1952): sentences of a language L that are used to characterise the
  appropriateness of formal models L are called meaning postulates; and we will
  * a set of sentences used for this purpose as as a postulate system.
* the truth of a meaning postulate like (39) may guarantee the truth or falsity
  of certain other sentences: (40) Every bachelor is not married.
  * Once (39) is adopted as a meaning postulate, there is no need to also take
  * need not be a general criterion for preferring one postulate system
* the effect of a meaning postulate, or a postulate system, may be achieved by
  other means. Thus, e.g., the effect of adopting (39) as a meaning postulate
  may also be obtained by the following constraint on appropriate formal models
  M = (U, F) for E: (42) F(bachelor) ∩ F(married) = ∅
* relation between the noun bachelor and the participle married (which we take
  * The relation is known as incompatibility and
    holds between any two expressions just in case
    their extensions of some type (a,t) cannot overlap.
* any meaning postulate S can be replaced by a corresponding constraint on
  formal models to the effect that S come out true; and given a procedure for
  * this constraint can be given directly in terms of the extensions of the
    (non-logical) lexical expressions S contains. On the other hand,
  * hE, not every constraint on formal models needs to correspond to a meaning
    postulate, or even a postulate system; cf. Zimmermann (1985) for an example
* more global constraints may rule out pure models that do not belong to Ersatz
  Space for cardinality reasons. In general, then, the set-theoretic
  reconstruction of Logical Space consists in formulating suitable constraints
  on the members of Model Space, i.e. the pure models.

Taken together, these constraints define a class K of appropriate models (according to the
constraints). Ideally, this class should coincide with Ersatz Space. The closer K gets to this
ideal, and the more it coincides with Ersatz Space in semantically relevant aspects, the
more descriptively adequate will K be. Thus, e.g., the set of K-valid sentences – those that
are true according to all M∈K – should be the same as the set of sentences that are true
throughout Logical Space.

If two formal models are isomorphic, both represent precisely the same material
models, and hence there is no reason for ruling out (or counting in) one but not the other.

* meta-constraint on classes K of appropriate models:
  (43) If M ≅ M', then M∈K iff M'∈K.
  * ie the class K of appropriate models is closed under isomorphism: if M and
  * as a consequence of (31), constraints formulated in terms of meaning
    postulates (or postulate systems) always satisfy (43): any two isomorphic
    models make the same sentences true
  * if the constraints are jointly satsifiable at all (which they should be),
    the appropriate models always form a proper class; this is so
    because for any formal model M = (U, F) and any set U ' of the same
    cardinality as U,
    there is an isomorphic model of the form M' = (U ', F ') – and hence
    any pure set whatsoever will be a member of some universe of an appropriate
    formal model.
  * => no matter how closely a given system of constraints and/or meaning
    postulates may approximate Logical Space, it will never be able to pin down
    a specific model, let alone specific extensions of all expressions. In
    * given any term A (of some language L) and any pure set x,
      there will be an appropriate model M x = (U x , F) (for L), according to
      which [[A]] M x = x;
    * M x may be constructed from any given appropriate model M = (U, F)
      by replacing [[A]] M with x (and simultaneously x with U, in case x∈U)
      – thereby preserving appropriateness, by (43). This only reflects the
      strategy of having inhabitants of Logical Space represented by arbitrary
      set-theoretic objects and is thus hardly surprising.
    * a similar line of thought does give rise to
      interesting consequences for the relation between reference and truth.
      This is the gist of the following permutation argument,
      * made famous by Putnam (1977, 1980) with predecessors including Newman
        (1928), Jeffrey (1964), Field (1975), and Wallace (1977);
        * see Devitt (1983), Lewis (1984), Abbott (1997), Williams (2005), and
          Button (2011) for critical discussion of its impact.
Given a model M for a language L, the extensions according to any isomorphic
model `M*` may be characterised directly by an inductive specification in terms of M, without
mention of `M*`. For the present purposes, it suffices to consider the special case in which
M = (U, F) and `M* = (U*, F*)` are models for our extensional fragment of English and
share their universe `U = U*`. More specifically, since any bijection π on U is a model-
isomorphism from M to a model `M* = (U*, F*)`, the following induction characterises the
extensions relative to `M*` entirely in terms of M:
(44) For any expression A of E and any formal model M = (U, F) for E,
  the permuted extension of A relative to M – //A// M – is determined by the
  following induction (on the grammatical complexity of A):
  (i-a) //and // M = λu. λv. u × v
  ...
  ...
  (ii-a) //every// M = λP. λQ. ⊢P ⊆ Q⊣
  ...
  ...
  (iii)
  ... where u∈{0,1} and v∈{0,1}
  where P⊆U and Q⊆U
  //A// M = π τ(A) (F w (A)), if A∈N E
  (iv-a) //D N// M = //D// M (//A// M )
  if D N is a quantifier phrase, where D is a quantificational determiner and N
  is a count noun;
  ...
  ...

Obviously, `//A// M = π τ(A) ([[A]] M ) = [[A]] M*` , for any expression A of E. Moreover, there
is a striking similariy between (44) and the specification (38) of the extensions relative
to M. In fact, the only difference lies in clause (iii): according to (44), non-logical
words are assigned the π-image of the U-extension they are assigned according to (38).

The formulation of (44iii) may suggest that the values //A// M somehow depend on the
permutation π when of course, they are perfectly independent U-extensions in their
own right – just like the values [[A]] M : any instantiation of either (38iii) or (44iii) will
assign some specific U-extension to some specific expression. In particular, then, (44)
is no more complicated or roundabout than (38); it is just different. Yet, as far as the
specification of the truth values of sentences S of L is concerned, the two agree, since
//S// M = π τ ([[S]] M ) = [[S]] M .

The construction (44) can also be carried out if M = M w is a material model. Of
course, in this case the permutation model `M*` cannot be expected to be a material
model too, but then again it is not needed for the definition of the //A// M -values anyway.

All that is needed is a permutation π of the domain of w. (44) will then deliver exactly
the same truth valuation of L as (38). The comparison between (44) and (38) thus illus-
trates that truth is independent of reference in that the latter is not determined by the
former. In particular, then, although the extensions of terms help determining the truth
values of the sentences in which they occur, this rôle hopelessly underdetermines them:
if reference is merely contribution to truth, then reference is arbitrary;
else, reference has to be grounded independently.

## 3.2. Intensional Model Space 31

* A formal ontology is a pair (W, Û), where
  * W is a non-empty set (the worlds according to (W, Û) and
  * Û is a function with domain W such that Û(w) is a non-empty set whenever
    w∈W [= the individuals of w, according to (W, Û)].
* an intensional formal model (for L) is a quadruple M̂ = (W,Û, w*, F̂ ), where
  * (W, Û) is a formal ontology;
  * a member w* of W (= the actual world according to M̂); and
  * a function F̂ which assigns to every non-logical lexical expression A of L
    a (W, Û)-intension of type τ L (A)
    (= the lexical interpretation function according to M̂)
* intensional formal models : intensional material models :
  (extensional) formal models : (extensional) material models,
  * replacing any dubious entities by arbitrary set-theoretic constructions.
  * And like the extensional ones, intensional formal models can be used to
    determine the extensions of arbitrary expressions. To see this, we may
    * adapt procedure (38) to intensional formal models M̂ for a more inclusive
* necessarily expresses universal quantifi cation over possible worlds.
  * calling for a generalisation of the notion of logicality (as already sec 2)
  * characterisation in terms of replacements. Since extensions of
  * replacements also have to act simultaneously on all worlds and domains of a
* the same lexical item may be interpreted as conjunction in one model and as
  disjunction in another one – and still count as logical
  * To rule out this possibility, a global notion of logicality is needed, and
    can be defined in terms of (intensional) model isomorphisms.
* logical words are assigned invariant intensions in the earlier, local sense.
* Intensional Model Space. It is readily verifi ed that
  * each pure intensional model interprets the extensional part of the language
    in exactly the same way as a corresponding extensional model. It would thus
* contingent proposition within M̂, i.e. one that is
  neither empty nor coincides with M ’s logical space:
  `[[S]] M̂, w* =1, but ∅ ≠ {w ∈ W | [[S]] M̂, w =1} ≠ W`
* meaning postulate S should (not only/but) rule out
  * intensional models according to which S ßßis actually true
  * all those according to which S is true at some world
  * Though this may be achieved by prefixing S with the modal adverb
    necessarily,
    a more principled, language-independent way to guarantee the intended
    effect of meaning postulates is to
    adapt the definition of validity to non-extensional languages:
* Like (extensional) Model Space, Intensional Model Space can be taken as
  a starting point to the set-theoretic reconstruction of Logical Space,
  gradually reducing the abundance of models by suitable constraints. To this
  * meaning postulates employed in extensional semantics may be adapted in the
    way indicated, but they would have no effect on the interpretation of
    expressions of non-extensional types, for which additional postulates may
    be formulated
  * eg it has been argued that, due to the intensionality of their subject
    positions, certain verbs of change have extensions of type ((s,e),t); cf.
    Montague (1973), Löbner (1979), Lasersohn (2005). The analyses try to
    explain
  * Partee’s Paradox, i.e. the failure of the inference from
    The temperature is ninety and
    The temperature is rising to
    Ninety is rising.  The incompatibility of rise and fall may then be
    captured by adopting the following sentence as a meaning postulate – or by
    a corresponding meta-linguistic constraint:
* logically independent of each other. Certainly logical independence is a
  sense relation, holding between the expressions in virtue of their meaning.
  And even though it might not be particularly thrilling one, if semantic
  theory strives for completeness, it should not miss it.

## 3.3. Variants 38

* We have seen that constraints on (extensional or intensional) model space may
  go well beyond what is expressible in the object-language. However, they may
* indirect interpretation. This technique, which
  * goes back to Montague (1970), proceeds by
  * assigning meanings to natural language expressions by translating them into
    logical formulae, which are themselves interpreted model-theoretically. As
  * formal languages of higher-order type logic are particularly suited for
    this purpose, since they allow for step-by-step translation procedures
  * Janssen (1983) for technical details. At the same time,
  * these languages tend to be more expressive than the natural language
  * formulate more powerful restrictions on model space than the directly
    expressible meaning postulates considered above.
  * illustration of this technique may be found in Dowty (1979)
  * eg the property of being a referentially transparent (or first-order
    reducible) transitive verb can be expressed in type logic but not in
    pertinent fragments of English; cf. Zimmermann (1985) for details.
* Another respect in which traditional model-theoretic approaches to natural
  language semantics may diverge, concerns
  the location of logical material
  * In the above sketch, logicality crops up as a feature of
    * certain lexical items (logical words) and
      * determined by the models
    * of the logical operations on meanings that correspond to the grammatical
      constructions combining syntactic material.  ,
      * assigned as part of a model-independent global compositional
        interpretation procedure. In principle, we could have made them part of
        the models too, though, thereby making more space for variations
        between models – as in the classical account of Montague (1970), where
        however, logicality restrictions are not made explicit
An even more radical assimilation between (i) logical words and (ii) logical
operations is obtained when the latter are represented by underlying
‘functional’ morphemes, which opens the possibility of keeping the logical
combinations proper to a minimum. This approach is taken in LF-based
type-driven interpretation, as made popular by Heim & Kratzer (1998).

## 3.4. Mathematical Model Theory 39

* Model-theoretic interpretation originated in mathematical logic, where it is
  * Etchemendy (1990) for more on this difference in perspective, which
  * Though a large part of the math concern certain varieties of first-order
    predicate logic, they may have repercussions on model-theoretic semantics
    of natural language, especially if they concern
    questions of expressiveness
* The two most fundamental results of mathematical model theory – usually
  * corollaries to completeness of firstorder logic – are cases in point:
  * Compactness Theorem: a set Σ of (closed) first order formulae can only
    imply a particular (closed first-order) formula if the latter already
    follows from a finite subset of Σ. As a consequence,
    * => no first-order formula can express that the universe is infinite
      (though it may imply this) because such a formula would be implied by the
      set of (first-order expressible) sentences that say that there are at
      least n objects, but not by any of its finite subsets.
  * Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, a set Σ of (closed) first order formulae that
    is true in a model with an infinite universe, is true in models with
    universes of arbitrary infinite cardinalities. In particular,
    * no collection of first-order formulae can express that the universe has a
      particular infinite cardinality.
* a fundamental result of abstract model theory due to Lindström (1969),
  the above two theorems characterise first-order logic in that
  any language exceeding its expressive power is bound to fail at least one of
  them
  * natural languages have the resources to express
    * infinity; if they can also be shown to be able to express, say, the
    * ? countability of the universe, Lindström’s Theorem would imply that the
      notion of validity in them cannot be axiomatised – cf. Ebbinghaus+ (1994)
      for the technical background.  The model-theoretical study of
      higher-order logics is comparatively less well investigated, a major
* non-standard models are introduced to restore axiomatisability – at the price
  of losing the kinds of idealisations in the set-theoretic construction of
  denotations mentioned and motivated in Section 2;
  * a survey of the most fundamental results of higher-order model theory can
    be found in van Benthem & Doets (1983).
