Autoextend: Extending word embeddings to embeddings for synsets and lexemes. 
2015 ACL IJCNLP

* A lexeme pairs a particular spelling or pronunciation with a particular
  meaning, i.e., a lexeme is a conjunction of a word and a synset. Our
  premise is that many NLP applications will benefit if the non-word data
  types of resources – e.g., synsets in WordNet – are also available as embed-
  dings. For example, in machine translation, enriching and improving
  translation dictionaries (cf.  Mikolov et al. (2013b)) would benefit from
  these embeddings because they would enable us to create an enriched
  dictionary for word senses. Generally, our premise is that the arguments
  for the utility of embeddings for word forms should carry over to the utility
  of embeddings for other data types like synsets in WordNet.
