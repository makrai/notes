# Abstract

* Typology has the hallmarks of a mature discipline: a 
  society, conferences, journals, books, textbooks, classic works, a founding
  father, and people who are called and call themselves typologists. A
  * courses with a title like “Typology and Universals” which includes readings
    by Greenberg, Dixon, and Dryer, often a 
  * textbook such as Whaley (1997), Comrie (1989), Song (2001), and/or Croft
    (2003), and some grammar-reading assignments. With regard to research, the
  * method: typologist reads grammars, does at least some crosslinguistic
    research, has probably done some fieldwork and description, and 
  * usually does not identify with any particular named theoretical framework
* I: there is no such subfield of ling as the usual referent of “typology”
  * Despite these conspicuous [feltűnő] identifying marks
