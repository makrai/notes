# Abstract

* how the choice of words and sentence structure can
  affect/achieve widespread public awareness
* we develop an analysis framework and
  * build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information
* memorable quotes use
  * less common word choices, but at the same time are
  * built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns. Another is that
    * make them easy to apply in new contexts — that is, more portable
  * the concept of “memorable language” can be extended across domains

# 1 Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. [Introduction]

* memorable quotes have significantly lower LM likelihood
  than their nonmemorable counterparts at the level of words
  * with respect to lexical language models
    trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21] 
* POS composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely
* containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text
  * In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners

# 4 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away [Realted work]

* computational humor recognition [25]
