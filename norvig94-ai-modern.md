Artificial Intelligence -A Modern Approach
Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig
1994

#Preface

* principal features of the book
1. Unified presentation of the field.
  * [instead of] historical perspective 
  * reinterpretation of past research
  * include material not normally covered in AI texts.
2. Intelligent agent design.
  * The unifying theme of the book is the concept of an _intelligent agent_
  * different ways to represent [agents], such as 
    * production systems, reactive agents, logical planners, neural networks,
      and decision-theoretic systems
  * learning as extending the reach of the designer into unknown environments,
    * how it constrains agent design
  * robotics and vision not as independently defined problems, but as occurring
    in the service of goal achievement
3. Comprehensive and up-to-date coverage.
  * We cover ... reasoning under uncertainty, learning, neural networks,
    natural language, vision, robotics, and philosophical foundations
    * more recent ideas ... including simulated annealing, memory-bounded
      search, global ontologies, dynamic and adaptive probabilistic (Bayesian)
      networks, computational learning theory, and reinforcement learning
  * historical sources and current literature for ... each chapter
