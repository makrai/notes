# Opening Statement Anna Wierzbicka

* This set of papers is the first attempt ever to empirically test a
  hypothetical set of semantic and lexical universals across a number of
  genetically and typologically diverse languages
  * parallel and strictly comparable answers to the same set of questions
* a shared set of concepts, forming the common conceptual foundation of all
  cultures
  * the processes of consciousness may not be uniform across the cultural
    regions of the world

# Part 1: General

# 1 Semantic Theory and Semantic Universals Cliff Goddard 7

## 1.1 semantic theory underlying the present work

### 1. Semiotic Principle. A sign cannot be reduced to or analysed into any

 combination of things which are not themselves signs; Peirce (1932)
 * what philosophers know as a fully intensional conception of meaning. It is
 * incompatible with
  * reference-based or denotation-based approaches to meaning, such as
    classical truth-conditional semantics and more recent developments in
    'formal semantics'. It also precludes
  * neurophysiological approach in the way Kay and McDaniel (1978) went
    about 'defining' the meaning of colour terms
  * speakers' usage (in the way Labov (1973) approach
  * embodied action-schemata (in the style of Johnson (1987) and Lakoff
    (1987))
* taken for granted in
  * much semiotic work (cf. Eco 1984)
  * European structural semanticists (e.g.  Greimas 1966, 1987)
* only rarely endorsed in the mainstream Anglo-American linguistic
  literature
* found in the work of Yorick Wilks and Jerrol Katz

### 2. exhaustive decomposition into discrete terms

* Principle of Discrete and Exhaustive Analysis
  * in a fully determinate way; that is, any complex meaning can be
    decomposed into a combination of discrete other meanings, without
    circularity and without residue
* The pursuit of _exhaustive_ analysis distinguishes the present approach from
  the tradition of _componential analysis_ which attempts to capture only
  that portion of a word's meaning which enters into _systematic opposition_
  with other word-meanings, as in the work of Hjelmslev, Pottier, Coseriu,
  Nida, Katz, Lehrer and Jackendoff
  * Katz and Jackendoff, who both believe that for many words an unanalysable
    residue of meaning remains
* Commitment to semantic representation in _discrete_ terms distinguishes the
  present approach from that of Lakoff (1987), Coleman and Kay (1981) and
  others who propose _scalar_ notations for semantics, such as 'fuzzy set
  theory'

### 3. Semantic Primitives Principle. There exists a finite set of undecomposable

 meanings — semantic primitives
 * does not mean that all lexical universals must also be semantic
   primitives. For example, it appears that all languages have a word
   corresponding to 'mother'
 * Semantic primitives have an elementary _syntax_ whereby they combine to form
   'simple propositions'
 * From their different standpoints, Katz and Fodor (1963), Postal (1966;
   cited in Bierwisch 1967:3), Fillmore (1971), McCawley (1968, 1970) and
   Lakoff (1970, 1972) all subscribed to the existence of semantic
   primitives, also called elementary meaning components or atomic concepts

   > The meaning of a lexical item  it is analysable into atomic
   > conceptual elements

 * Others interested in modelling the nature of language comprehension,
  * such as
    * psychologists Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) and
    * artificial intelligence researchers Wilks (1976, 1977) and Schank
      (1972),
  * also upheld the concept of semantic primitives
    (even going beyond most linguists in proposing a concrete set)
  * Since the 1970s, general enthusiasm for semantic primitives has subsided,
    for reasons we will consider in section 1.2
  * their most persistent advocate has been Anna Wierzbicka

### 4. The metalanguage of semantic representation

* a minimal subset of ordinary natural language (Natural Semantic Metalanguage
  (NSM) approach)
 * a defining metalanguage which is independent of natural language
* three sorts of position can be identified in the literature
 1. Furthest from the spirit of Principle (IV) are proposals which employ
    _obscure technical terms_ to represent posited primitives
    * McCawley (1968) used technical symbols borrowed from symbolic logic,
      such as \exists and \forall
    * Schank (1972) designated three of his fundamental conceptual
      categories as PACT, CACT and TACT
    * such terms stand in need of explanation in ordinary English
      This may be
        * explicitly given, as with novel terminologies such as those
          of Schank (who explains the terms just mentioned as 'physical
          act', 'communication act' and 'transfer act'); or,
        * if the technical notation is well-established within the academic
          community, as with logical symbols
 2. generative semantics, writers like McCawley, Lakoff and Ross put
 forward analyses couched for the most part in English words —
  * such as CAUSE, NOT, BECOME and ALIVE
  * intended meanings were not (exactly) those of the English words, but
    were more 'abstract'
    * criticised (Kempson 1977:92-96; Wierzbicka 1980; cf. Lyons 1977)
 3. semi-technical nature
  * Katz (1987:186-187) uses labels like these to identify the 'conceptual
    components' of the English word chase:
    * Activity, Physical, Movement, Fast, Direction, Toward location of,
      Purpose, Catching
  * As argued by Allan (1986:265-270), such semi-technical notations are
    nothing more or less than a "degenerate form of a natural language" To
    understand such 'markerese' we mentally undo the unstated deformation
    conditions and convert it back to a paraphrase in ordinary English (for
    instance, 'a physical activity of fast movement in a direction toward
    something, with the purpose of catching that something')
* natural syntax attaching to the primitives
* In early versions of componentialism, the syntax of semantic
  representation was envisaged as merely the _conjunction_ of features into
  a 'bundle',
* a version of the predicate-argument syntax of predicate calculus;
* others use variants of phrase-structure tree diagrams or labelled
  bracketing; and
* various forms of labelled dependency diagrams are also in use. But
* never is the syntax of the notation viewed as a natural consequence of
  the fact that the items representing primitive meanings are lexemes or
  morphemes drawn from an ordinary language: it is rather an artificial,
  extra-linguistic syntax devised and imposed by the analyst

### 5. Expressive Equivalence of NSMs. The NSMs derived from various languages

 will have the same expressive power.  Any simple proposition expressible
 in an NSM based on `L_1` will be expressible in an NSM based on `L_2`

### 6. Principle (VI): the linguistic exponents of semantically primitive meanings

 in different languages can be placed into one-to-one correspondence
 * differences like allolexy and part-of-speech membership; see section 2.1
   and chapter 17)
 * entails that the exponents of semantic primitives in different languages
   share a common set of combinatorial properties

### 7.  Strong Lexicalisation Hypothesis. Every semantically primitive meaning can

  be expressed through a distinct word, morpheme or fixed phrase in every
  language
  * it sometimes happens that the same form serves as an exponent of
    different primitives, although their distinct syntactic frames make it
    appropriate to recognise polysemy
    * in this volume the term 'polysemy' is used to cover both homonymy and
      the situation of related meanings
  * an exponent of a semantically primitive meaning may be _formally
    complex_, including elements which function elsewhere as full morphemes
    (These points are dealt with more fully in section 2.1.)
  * a semantically primitive meaning will always be expounded by means of
    specifically lexical material — be it a bound morpheme, a lexeme or a
    fixed phrase (or phraseme); to put it another way, that the linguistic
    exponents of primitive meanings will always be 'segmental signs'
  * corner cases
    * Goddard (1989) floated the idea that the imperative construction could be
      taken as the true universal exponent of the notion of 'wanting', if it
      turned out that lexical equivalents for WANT were lacking in some
      languages
    * Evans (this volume) and Chappell (this volume) consider the possibility
      that the PART OF notion is not lexicalised in Kayardild and Mandarin, but
      might be expressible through an inalienable possession-type grammatical
      construction
    * 'modifying' (such as LIKE or VERY) might lack a distinct lexical identity
      if a language possessed a set of portmanteau morphemes (Evans, this volume)
    * a primitive meaning may have no exponent at all, neither lexical nor
      grammatical (Hale, this volume)
  * at this early stage of investigation into lexical and semantic universals
    it seems methodologically sounder to provisionally adopt the Strong
    Lexicalisation Hypothesis
  * Lyons (1977:331-332) applies a distinction
    * _Formal universals_ concern the principles by which sense-components are
      combined to yield the meanings of lexemes;
    * _substantive universals_ concern the identity of semantic components
    * the most extreme form of substantive universalism, that "there is a
      fixed set of semantic components, which are universal in that they are
      lexicalised in all languages
    * that is precisely the thesis to be tested in the present work

## 1.2 literature on semantic and lexical universals in the 20th century

* The following review restricts itself
  * to ideas about substantive semantic universals
  * not take in the work of Wierzbicka and associates,
    * which is dealt with in section 1.3
* although the great descriptive linguists of the early part of the century
  seemed confident that all human languages rested on a universal conceptual
  base, they did little to characterise that base in substantive terms
* The sole exception was the work of Sapir's student Swadesh (1955),
* both the major European schools of post-Saussurean structuralism, the Prague
  School and the Copenhagen School, arrived at the view that word-meanings,
  like phonemes, could be analysed into _distinctive features_,

  > although the complexes of components are unique to particular
  > languages, the ultimate components of sound and meaning are
  > language-neutral.  (Lyons 1977:245)

* Prague School (especially through the person of Roman Jakobson)
* generativist ideas about semantic primitives in the mid-1960s and the 1970s,
  * Fillmore (1971:372) cited his
    * eight examples of the "ultimate terms of semantic description" —
      * identity, time, space, body, movement, territory, life and fear
      * "presumably biologically given notions"
  * Bierwisch (1967:3-4) believed that universal semantic markers corresponded
    to "certain deep seated, innate properties of the human organism and the
    perceptual apparatus", and spoke of a "biological determination" of the
    ultimate components of concepts
  * Katz maintained that the inventory of potential semantic markers is innate
    and universal because of their physiological basis (cf. Katz & Nagel 1974)
  * Berlin and Kay's (1969) discoveries about universals of colour terminology
  * unfortunate consequence of this 'biological turn' in thinking was the
    apparent assumption that semantic universals were not only
    language-independent (in the sense of language-universal), but
    _extra-linguistic_ in nature
  * To the best of my knowledge, no-one from either the Interpretive Semantics
    or the Generative Semantics camps, or any of their intellectual heirs or
    successors; has proposed any substantial _inventory_ of universal semantic
    elements. Where a few samples have been offered, such as those referred to
    above, it was on the basis of a handful of sketched analyses, with no
    detailed consideration of methodology
* most important contemporary sources of substantive semantic universals
  (again excepting the work of Wierzbicka and associates)
  to be found in John Lyons, RMW Dixon, and the linguists of the Moscow School:
* Lyons
  * associated with the term 'structural semantics'
  * the inheritor of Jespersen's view that there are notional universals
  * noun and verb are at least partly "determined ontologically"
    (Lyons 1989)
  * his discussion of substantive universals is relatively limited
* Dixon
  * "the syntactic properties of a lexical item can be largely predicted from
    its semantic description" (1982:8)
  * long association with Wierzbicka but their semantics differ
  * the lexicon as consisting of two natural groups —
    nuclear words and non-nuclear words
    * suggested by certain Australian languages
    * Componential descriptions of nuclear verbs are generated from systems of
      primitive semantic features;
    * non-nuclear verbs are defined in terms of the nuclear verbs (or of
      already defined non-nuclear verbs) utilising the full grammatical
      possibilities of the language in the formulation of these definitions
    * universal semantic 'types',
      * not the ultimate elements of semantic theory, but
        about the mechanism of semantic-syntactic correspondence
* Moscow School
  * Russian scholars like Jurij Apresjan, Lidija Iordanskaja, Igor Mel'cuk
    and Aleksandr Zolkovskij
  * construction of a non-arbitary semantic metalanguage,
  * 'elementary senses' may be combined in various ways, according to
    the grammar of the semantic language (which is also non-arbitrary),
  * In the early period of the development of the Meaning-Text Model (MTM),
    the semantic language and its lexicon was the main object of interest
  * Zolkovskij  proposed an inventory of 23 semantic primitives
  * Apresjan (1992 1974:53) listed 27 'basic meanings'
  * primitive meanings not necessarily correspond to ordinary words
  * they could be made perfectly clear through examples
  * The 'semantic networks' by which the meaning of a lexical item is
    stated in the MTM are not constructed within any postulated set of
    elementary senses, and their syntax is based on predicate calculus,
    rather than being drawn from the language being analysed
  * according to Mel'cuk there is no reason to believe, on the assumptions
    of the Meaning-Text Model, that the elementary lexical meanings of
    different languages correspond

## The NSM Search for Universal Semantic Primitives p20

* list,
  * first published in English in the book Semantic primitives (Wierzbicka 1972:15-16)
  * 14 elements
  * I, YOU, SOMEONE, SOMETHING, WORLD, THIS, WANT, DON'T WANT, FEEL, THINK OF,
    IMAGINE, SAY, BECOME, BE A PART OF
  * In Wierzbicka's (1980) book Lingua mentalis this list was slightly modified
    * KNOW and BE IN A PLACE were tentatively added, and
    * FEEL discarded (though the latter has since made a comeback)
* studies of diverse areas of the lexicon,
  e.g. speech act verbs, emotion terms, simple and complex artefacts,
  mass nouns, natural kinds, superordinate functional categories, and
  ideological and value terms, among others
  (see references at end of this chapter)
* languages
  * Wierzbicka herself did work on English, Polish, Russian and Japanese
  * fieldwork and practical linguistic description of Australian Aboriginal
    languages ..., to Chinese (Chappell), and to Ewe (Ameka)
* earlier analyses for the domains of time, space, quantification and cognition
  needed improvement (cf. Goddard 1989; Wierzbicka 1989)
  * Semantic Primitives Workshop held in Adelaide in 1986,
* syntax is set out below and will be discussed in some detail in chapter 2
  * Though some account has been taken of other languages in this
    formulation, it has been derived in the main through 'deep' semantic
    investigations conducted in European languages
  * Reliance on English-specific syntax in early NSM explications (e.g. in
    Wierzbicka 1980) was noted with disapproval by a number of critics, for
    instance McCawley (1983:655), who called for the primitive vocabulary items
    to be supplemented with "a list of semantically primitive syntactic
    constructions"
  * Considerable progress has since been made toward this goal, as explained in
    Wierzbicka (1991) and in chapter 2 of the present book

## 1.4 Goals and Methods of the Present Project p22

* The purpose of the present project is to submit the list of proposed
  primitives in Table 1 to its first thorough cross-linguistic test
4. To claim that two words are similar but not identical in meaning, it must be
   possible to identify the supposed difference in meaning
* two words (morphemes, etc.) can be identical in meaning despite
  * belonging to different parts of speech
  * very different ranges of use for cultural reasons, or because of
  * different patterns of polysemy
  * (For discussion of all these points, see section 2.1.)
* a list of canonical contexts
  * (see Appendix to chapter 2) giving
  * a selection of syntactic (combinatorial) contexts in which the proposed
    semantically primitive meanings can be expected to be found
  * informed by on-going research into the 'elementary syntax' of semantic
    primitives
  * see Wierzbicka (1991)
* the type of data considered by contributors
* the list of contexts
  * assisted in overcoming potential confusion about which sense of a
    polysemous English word is proposed as semantically primitive
  * was to identify the most plausible candidates for exponents of primitives
    * There was a lot of noise; because of that I couldn t sleep and He hit me;
      that's why I'm crying
* Further discussion of methodological issues and a preliminary review of the
entire proposed primitive inventory is provided in chapter 2

# 2 Introducing Lexical Primitives; Cliff Goddard and Anna Wierzbicka 31

* The main part of this chapter surveys the proposed primitive inventory whose
  cross-linguistic validity is being put to the test in this book. Before
  embarking on this exercise, we address some methodological issues

## 2.1 Methodological Issues

### 2.1.1 The Problem of Polysemy

* polysemy must never be postulated lightly, and that it
  * has to be justified on language-internal grounds; but
  * to reject polysemy in a dogmatic and a priori fashion is just as foolish as
    to postulate it without justification
  * basic, everyday words are particularly likely to be polysemous (Zipf 1949)
* feel is polysemous between
  * its semantically primitive sense (I feel good/had), its
  * action sense (I felt her pulse) and its
  * cognitive sense (I feel it's wrong)
  Lagos: a 2. és 3. jelentés a szem primitív + valami
* not based on comparisons between range of use across languages
* To prove that a word is polysemous one has to demonstrate that they
  call for distinct reductive paraphrase explications
  * For instance, it can be shown that the action and cognitive senses of
    feel contain the elements DO and THINK respectively, thereby establishing
    these senses as complex and distinct from the semantically primitive
    FEEL
  * a diagnostic of polysemy is mutually exclusive syntactic frames or
    combinatorial possibilities (cf.  Weinreich 1966:177-183)
    * e.g. _know_
      * +/- takes a sentential that-complement,
      * Modern English you: forms yourself and yourselves,
    * even if both are primitive


### 2.1.2 Formal versus Semantic Complexity

* The words SOMEONE and SOMETHING are both formally analysable, but in neither
  case is the meaning of the whole word the sum of the parts;

### 2.1.3 Allomorphy and Allolexy

* e.g
  * the combination of the meanings THIS and SOMEONE is more naturally
    expressed as `this person`, rather than as `this someone`; because it is
    not possible to specify any semantic difference between `this person` and
    THIS SOMEONE, the term person may be regarded in this context as an allolex
    of SOMEONE
  * Japanese `this` nominal modifier vs a referring expression in its own right
* how to reconcile the existence of language-specific morphosyntactic
  categories with the NSM claim that the semantic metalanguage is isomorphic
  across languages?
  * in the natural semantic metalanguage based on Latin, volo would never occur
    without an explicit subject

### 2.1.4 Differences in Range of Use

* without this in any way invalidating their claim to semantic equivalence
* Yankunytjatjara exponent of the semantic element BECAUSE, namely a particular
  use of the ablative case-marker -nguru, is much rarer in ordinary discourse
  than the word because (or 'cos) is in English. Part of the reason is that
  Yankunytjatjara possesses two extremely common purposive constructions,
* social and cultural factors

### 2.1.5 Resonance

1. non-paraphrasable effects resulting from the association between an exponent
   and other, complex meanings also expressible by the same lexical form.  For
   instance, English feel may expound FEEL, but the same word also expresses
   meanings to do with the sense of touch; whereas the Malay equivalent _rasa_ is
   poly-semous with the meaning 'taste', and the Yankunytjatjara equivalent
   tjuni with the meaning 'belly'
2. a result of formal complexity. For instance  English someone and
   something
3. sound shape (or even the graphic shape)
* Here we acknowledge the possible existence of resonance effects primarily for
  the sake of completeness. By definition, they inhere in relationships between
  form and meaning which cannot be captured in paraphrases, and they are
  inherently language-specific.  From the NSM point of view, once having
  acknowledged their existence there is little to say
  * Wittgenstein: not attempt to speak of what cannot be spoken of

### 2.1.6 Non-Compositional Relationships

* assumption was that it would seem that if two concepts had something in
  common they could not both be semantically indivisible
* e.g
  * YOU and I are not independent of SOMEONE
  * THINK, KNOW, WANT and FEEL have something in common (mental proc/state)
  * GOOD seems to be intuitively related in some way to WANT,
    * as a long line of philosophers have suggested; and
  * BECAUSE and CAN seem to be related to IF (cf. Austin 1961)

## 2.2 The Proposed Primitive Inventory p37

* In some cases, we will discuss and
  * refute putative decompositions which are circulating
  * indicate areas where the elements have proved  indispensable

### 2.2.1 Substantives: I, YOU, SOMEONE, SOMETHING, PEOPLE p37

* pronouns
* universal fact about human languages that the word for 'what' or 'something'
  applies not only to (discrete) objects but also to situations, 'stuffs',
  states of affairs, and so on,
* `I` ?= `the person who says this`
* tegezés/magázás
* `PEOPLE` is needed for the explication of
  * moral and social concepts such as 'charity', 'conceit', 'solidarity',
    'service', and
  * emotional concepts such as 'shame' and 'pride', which
  * components such as 'people (would) think this is bad/good'
  * 'cultural scripts' embodying shared understandings about interactive
    conventions within a given society

### 2.2.2 Mental Predicates: THINK, SAY, KNOW, FEEL, WANT p39

* complement
* KNOW
  * in the analysis of
    * illocutionary forces and in the area of syntactic complementation
    * perception words like _see, hear_
    * propositional attitude verbs like _doubt, expect, wonder_ and many others
  * has a much better chance of being a genuine lexical universal than `true`,
    which many semanticists treat as a fundamental concept
* Some languages have been reported not to distinguish lexically between THINK
  and FEEL (Lutz 1985; Levy 1973; Howell 1981), but is apperars that azért nem
  találták az érez szó megfelelőjét, mert az, ami ezt valóban kifejezi, az
  homonim volt egy konkrét jelentésű szóval pl. “has” vagy “belső”
* Polysemy between WANT and SAY, however, is not uncommon in e.g. New Guinea
* feel
  * for the semantic analysis of words for emotions and sensations, as well as
    for interjections, speech act verbs, 'experiencer constructions', etc.
  * canonical contexts: 'feel (something) good/bad'

### 2.2.3 Determiners and Quantifiers p39

* THIS, THE SAME, OTHER, ONE, TWO, MANY, ALL
* THIS is neutral with respect to animacy, personhood and discreteness:
  * though every language appears to distinguish 'who' from 'what', none appears
  to distinguish between 'this who ' and 'this what '
  * not necessarily restricted to a 'modifying' role, but may be used on its
    own to refer directly to a situation, or to some aspect of a situation
  * here = this+where, now = this+when
  * words such as thus and so suggest that it can also be combined with the
    element LIKE
  Ez a fiú jó/Ez jó
* two: dual body parts such as eyes, ears, hands and legs. The
  * wide occurrence of dual pronouns (especially in languages which don't have
    highly developed systems of numerals)
  * along with other elements such as PART OF, to explicate the higher numerals
* ALL: universality assumed in the logical literature
* THE SAME and LIKE correspond loosely to two fundamental logical relations,
  identity and similarity, which both occupy a prominent place in the philo­
  sophical literature concerning thought and knowledge
  * needed in semantic analysis of
    * many conjunctions and particles, such as also, too and and
    * grammatical devices such as switch-reference
* OTHER is needed for reciprocals, comparatives and non-singular pronouns, for
  the decomposition of numerous lexical items involving the notions of parts
  and kinds, and for some grammatical phenomena such as switch-reference
* we have negation
* All the determiner-like and quantifier-like elements in this grouping can ..
  be combinable with the substantives SOMEONE, SOMETHING and PEOPLE,
  * other 'complex substantives'  like 'the same person', 'two people',
    'the same two people', 'these two people', and so on in many languages,
    are normally realised as 'third-person pronouns'

### 2.2.4 Actions and Events: DO, HAPPEN (TO) p42

* do `tesz, csinál`
* polysemy is often involved, particularly with exponents of SAY and HAPPEN
* 'agency' in the grammar of natural languages
  * the fundamentals of morality, and of law,
* difference between DO, on the one hand, and THINK, KNOW and SAY, on the
  other, involves their relationship to time
* This inherent relationship with time links DO with the impersonal HAPPEN
* happen
  * things don't just 'happen', they happen in (or to) a place, a thing, or a
    person
  * not some abstract 'event' in the sense philosophers often give to this
    word, but an event affecting someone or something. It is closer,
    therefore, to the linguistic notion of 'patient' than to the philosophical
    notion of 'event'
* frequent lexical links between the exponents of `do` and `happen_to`

### 2.2.5 Meta-Predicates: NO, IF, CAN, LIKE, BECAUSE, VERY p43

* NO has an inherently first-person orientation, representing the speaker's
  rejection of something — an offer, a request, a statement, food, unwelcome
  sexual advances or whatever.  This meaning is comparable to that of the
  expression '(I) don't want'
* imagination is a basic and irreducible aspect of human life, manifested in
  children's play, in fantasy, dreams, pretending, works of fiction, and so on
  * Originally it was represented in NSM by the verb 'imagine', but it is
  * now a modal device indicating the speaker's attitude
    * an element such as IF
* can
  * 'can of ability': I can = 'if I want I will ...'
  * this does not analyse away the notion of 'possibility'
    * 'possibility' cannot be convincingly defined via wanting or imagination
      There are things which we can imagine but which we know cannot happen
  * difficult to identify cross-linguistically, partly because
    * often involved in complex patterns of polysemy
    * often appear to be bound morphemes
* LIKE
  * crucial for the prototype-style analyses needed for emotions, speech acts,
    colours and kinship
  * many languages have special allolexes for the combination LIKE THIS, or
    even for more specialised combinations such as DO LIKE THIS, HAPPEN LIKE
    THIS or SAY LIKE THIS
* BECAUSE, it was once believed (Wierzbicka 1972:17) that this concept could be
  defined away, by means of an analysis similar to that used by logicians for
  the relationship of 'material implication':
  * many languages do not have a word BECAUSE,
    * many words which can mean either BECAUSE or, for example, 'from' (or
      'after') can be legitimately regarded as polysemous
* VERY
  * for expressive evaluations, such as wonderful, marvellous, terrific

### 2.2.6 Time and Place: WHEN, WHERE, AFTER, BEFORE, UNDER, ABOVE p45

* there must be in any language some complex ones: 'at this time', 'at the same
  time', 'at some time before this time' and so on.  And similarly for places,
  we predict or expect that in any language one could express meanings such as
  'in this place' and 'in the same place'
* BEFORE and AFTER, and UNDER and ABOVE

### 2.2.7 Taxonomy and Partonomy: KIND OF, HAVE PARTS p46

* both are inherently 'relational', and also that although both appear to be
  fundamental to human conceptualisation, they nevertheless present some
  difficulties in terms of cross-linguistic lexical identification
* `kind_of`
  * categorisation cannot be reduced to notions such as likeness or similarity
  * natural kinds (e.g. dog, oak, daffodil) and
  * cultural kinds (e.g. cup, bottle, chair)
* Rather than it taking a form analogous to English `part of`, recent research
  suggests an exponent with the converse orientation is more widely attested,
  that is, an element like `HAVE PARTS`
  * the very concept of 'parthood' does imply the existence of more than a
    single part
  * in some languages there is no separate lexical item for 'part', but the
    word meaning 'thing' can be used in a construction

### 2.2.8 Evaluators and Descriptors: GOOD, BAD, BIG, SMALL p47

* a basis on which morality, law and religion rest
* Earlier NSM work (Wierzbicka 1972) assumed that the concepts in question were
  not elementary — that GOOD, for instance, could be defined in terms of WANT
  and negation
  * but conflict between the inherently subjective perspective of WANT, as
    opposed the inherently objective perspective of GOOD and BAD
* difficulties involved in identifying these concepts cross-linguistically are
  due to the superabundance of plausible candidates
  * Russian
    * two different words corresponding to the English good
    * three words corresponding to bad
* have no relation to time

# 17 Semantic Primitives Across Languages:
  A Critical Review Anna Wierzbicka p445

* polysemy (in a broad sense, covering also homonymy) is a major problem. If,
  for example, it is discovered that in a language the same word can be glossed
  as both SAY and WANT,
  * The first assumption should always be that a word or morpheme has only one
    meaning;
  * Patterns of polysemy recurring in many languages
* 'allolexy':
* if our semantic metalanguage is to be carved out of natural language, neither
  of no polysemy, no synonymy/allolexy can be met in a straightforward
  manner:

## 17.1 Substantives 447
## 17.2 Mental Predicates
## 17.3 Determiners and Quantifiers
## 17.4 Actions and Events (Do and HAPPEN)
## 17.5 Meta-Predicates
## 17.6 Time and Place
## 17.7 Partonomy and Taxonomy
## 17.8 Evaluators and Descriptors
## 17.9 Conclusion p497

* the most controversial case has proved to be that of PART,
* The primitives repeatedly vindicated in this way include, in particular,
  SOMEONE, THE SAME, ALL, WANT, THINK, FEEL, BECAUSE, IF, CAN, AFTER and KIND
