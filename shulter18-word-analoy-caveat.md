# Abstract

* problems in the evaluation of word embeddings using standard word analogy
* standard word analogy test implementation practices provide distorted or
  contrived results. We
* concerns regarding the use of Principal Component Analysis to 2 or 3
  dimensions as a provision of visual evidence for the existence of word analogy
* we propose some solutions to these problems.
