Chinese script and the diversity of writing systems
Geoffrey Sampson

# Abstract

* DeFrancis (1989) claims that all writing systems are phonetically based.
  * Chinese script is essentially a syllabic phonographic system.  The present
* we: DeFrancis confuses diachrony with synchrony
  * It may be correct that the creation of a script always involves phonetic
  * hE subsequent evolution of script and spoken language can remove the
    phonetic basis of a writing system
  * difficult to agree that modern Chinese writing is essent phonetically-based
  * certain: phonetic motivation is not a necessary feature for a script
