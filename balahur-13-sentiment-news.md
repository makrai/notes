# Abstract

* different text types
  * highly subjective text types (movie or product reviews)
    * target is clearly defined and unique across the text
  * news opinion mining is different from that of other text types
    * three subtasks that need to be addressed:
      * definition of the target;
      * separation of the good and bad news content from the good and bad
        sentiment expressed on the target; and
      * analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not
        needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge
  * three views on newspaper articles
    * author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at the
      time of analysing sentiment.  Given these definitions, we present work on
      mining opinions about entities in English language news
* we
  * test the relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we
  * attempt to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news.  In
  * expers: whether or not subject domain-defining vocabulary should be ignored
    => this idea is more appropriate in the context of news opinion mining and
    * the approaches taking this into consideration produce a better performanc

# Intro

* The EMM applications NewsBrief and MedISys
  categorise the news into 1 or more of several hundred subject domain classes,
  eg, natural disasters, security, finance, nuclear issues, various diseases,
  organisations, countries, regions, specific conflicts, etc
  * Categorisation is achieved by (often user-defined) Boolean search word
    expressions or by using lists of search words
