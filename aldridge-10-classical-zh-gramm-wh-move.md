Clause-internal wh-movement in Archaic Chinese
Edith Aldridge

# Abstract

* we analyze wh-movement in late archaic Chinese
  as clause-internal focus fronting to the edge of vP. The paper further shows
  * archaic Chinese wh-words were indefinites, as in modern Chinese, and that
  * their interpretation was obtained in the c-command domain of an appropriate
    trigger, a base-generated operator in [Spec, CP] in the case of
    wh-questions
  * The non-quantificational status of wh-words accords well with the
    short movement analysis since this movement did
    * not serve to place the wh-word in the interrogative scope position in the
      left periphery of the clause. In
  * relationship between wh-movement and
    the status of wh-words as operators or indefinites. The conclusion here
  * movement of wh-indefinites is not unexpected
    if the landing site is lower than the interrogative scope position
