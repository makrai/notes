# Abstract

* this paper: multiling sentence embed, spec LASER, in intent classif
* using Zero-shot learning
* Several machine learning models were developed & their outputs were compared
* the Language Agnostic Sentence Representations or LASER which uses a single
  encoder to give sentence embedding vector for sentences in any language
