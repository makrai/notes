A Review of Relational Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs

# Abstract

* two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, 
  * both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on 
  * latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural
    networks.  The second is based on 
  * mining observable patterns in the graph.  We also show how to 
  * combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power
* Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined
  with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing
  knowledge graphs from the Web, e.g. Google's knowledge vault project
