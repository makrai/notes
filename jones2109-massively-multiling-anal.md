# Abstract

* cross-lingual LMs, reprs for many different languages in the same space
* we investigate the linguistic and non-linguistic factors affecting
  sentence-level alignment in cross-lingual pretrained language models for 101
  languages and 5,050 language pairs. Using 
  * BERT-based LaBSE and BiLSTM-based LASER as our models, and 
  * the Bible as our corpus, we compute a 
  * measures
    * task-based measure of cross-lingual alignment in the form of 
      bitext retrieval performance, as well as 
    * four intrinsic measures of vector space alignment and isomorphism. 
* We then examine a range of linguistic, quasi-linguistic, and training-related
  features as potential predictors of these alignment metrics.  The results of
  * word order agreement and agreement in morphological complexity are two of
    the strongest linguistic predictors of cross-linguality.  We also note
    * (similarly to Pires+ 2019) 
  * in-family training data as a stronger predictor than language-specific
    training data across the board. 
  * moderate effects of other typological measures on crosslinguality. In the
* We verify some of our linguistic findings by looking at the effect of
  morphological segmentation on English-Inuktitut alignment, in addition to
  examining the effect of word order agreement on isomorphism for 66 zero-shot
  language pairs from a different corpus. We make the
