# Abstract

* we present a multi-modal approach for driver fatigue and distraction detect
  * Based on a driving simulator platform equipped with several sensors, we
    have designed a framework to acquire sensor data, process and extract
    features related to fatigue and distraction. Ultimately the features from
    the different sources are fused to infer the driver’s state of inattention.
  * we extract audio, color video, depth map, heart rate, and steering wheel
    and pedals positions. We then process the signals according to three
