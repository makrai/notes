Obituary Charles J. Fillmore
2014

* Fillmore had become interested in argument structure by studying Lucien
  Tesnière’s groundbreaking _Éléments de Syntaxe Structurale_ (Tesnière 1959)
  in which the term ‘dependency’ was introduced and the foundations were laid
  for dependency grammar
* capture the relationships between distinct formal patterns with
  systematically related meanings; and he became interested in the
  * different ways of expressing the object and recipient of transfer in
    sentences like “He gave a book to me” and “He gave me a book” (Fillmore
    1962, 1965), a phenomenon that became known as dative movement.  He then
    expanded to how the participants in an event are expressed
    syntactically, as in causative alternations about an event of opening
* terminology
  * Following Tesnière’s terminology, Fillmore first referred to these argument
    roles as actants (Fillmore 1966) but
  * switched to the term _case_, (see Fillmore (2003))
* universal list of semantic roles or cases
  (Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.)
* obligatory (or optional) case arguments
* an intermediate level of semantic representation
* systems for extracting case frames were created for
  * machine translation (Wilks 1973),
  * question-answering (Hendrix, Thompson, and Slocum 1973),
  * spoken-language understanding (Nash-Webber 1975), and
  * dialogue systems (Bobrow+ 1977)
* General-purpose semantic role labelers
  * via ATNs (Simmons 1973) or,
  * from parse trees, by using dictionaries with verb-specific case frames
    (Levin 1977; Marcus 1980)
  * a standard component of natural language understanding in the first edition
    of Winston’s (1977) textbook Artificial Intelligence
* frames
  * 1971 linguistics faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, and
  * by the mid-1970s
  * a more general model of semantic representation, one
  * expresses the background contexts or perspectives by which a word or a
    case role could be defined
  * coming from
    * also called frames
      * “the pre-transformationalist view of sentence structure as
      consisting of a frame and a substitution list,”
      * proposed at about the same time by
        Minsky (1974), Hymes (1974), and Goffman (1974), as well as
    * with other names like
      * scripts (Schank and Abelson 1975) and
        schemata (Bobrow and Norman 1975)
        (see Tannen 1979 for a comparison)
      * semantic field theorists and
      * a visit to the Yale AI lab where he took notice of the
        lists of slots and fillers used by early _information extraction
        systems_ like DeJong (1982) and Schank and Abelson (1977)
  * Fillmore’s version of this new idea was more linguistic
  * expressed in a series of papers (Fillmore 1975a, 1976, 1977b, 1982, 1985)
  * motivating example was the Commercial Event frame
    (buy, sell, cost, pay, charge)
  * frames could represent perspectives on events, e.g. _sell_ vs _pay_
  * alternative senses of the same word might come from their drawing on
    different frames
  * influenced work
    * in artificial intelligence on knowledge representation like
      KRL (Bobrow and Winograd 1977), and the
    * perspective-taking aspect of frames influenced
      framing in linguistics and politics (Lakoff 2010)
* FrameNet
  * when he officially retired from UC Berkeley in 1995 he moved to the
    International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley
  * a project of computational corpus lexicography that
  * combined his early ideas on semantic roles with his
    later work on frames and his recent interest in corpus lexicography
  * a large set of frames, each of which consisted of
    * lists of constitutive roles or “frame elements”:
      sets of words that evoke the frame,
    * grammatical information expressing how each frame element is realized
    * semantic relations between frames and between frame elements
    * Corpora were annotated with the evoking words, frames, and frame elements
      (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; Fillmore, Johnson, and Petruck 2003;
      Fillmore and Baker 2009)
  * in the next 20 years until Fillmore's death, especially under the
    direction of Collin Baker
* PropBank semantic-role-labeled corpus (Palmer, Kingsbury, and Gildea 2005)
  * revival of automatic approaches to semantic role labeling
    * first on FrameNet (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000) and then
    * on PropBank data (Gildea and Palmer 2002, inter alia)
* plethora of systems for SRL
  * surveys in Palmer, Gildea, and Xue (2010) and Màrquez+ (2008))
  * applications to improve the SOTA in tasks across NLP such as
    * question answering
      (Shen and Lapata 2007; Surdeanu, Ciaramita, and Zaragoza 2011) and
    * machine translation (Liu and Gildea 2010; Lo+ 2013)
* FrameNets for many other languages including
  Spanish, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, and Chinese
  * return to the discovery procedures that first inspired Fillmore
    * induce semantic roles from corpora without role annotation (Swier and
      Stevenson 2004; Chambers and Jurafsky 2009, 2011; Lang and Lapata 2014)
* contributions to syntax and pragmatics, including the influential
  * Santa Cruz Lectures on _Deixis_ (Fillmore 1975b) and the long-standing
  * Construction Grammar (Fillmore, Kay, and O’Connor 1988)
* application of linguistics to other disciplines including
  cognitive science, education, and law (Ackerman, Kay, and O’Connor 2014)
* personal
  * wry deadpan wit
    * the deliberate display of a lack of or no emotion
  * encyclopedic knowledge of language
  * warmth, generosity
