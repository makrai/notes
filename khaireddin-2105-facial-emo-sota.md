# Abstract

* Facial emotion recognition (FER) is signif for human-computer interaction
  * clinical practice and behavioral description. Accurate and robust FER by
  * challenging due to the heterogeneity of human faces and variations in
    images such as different facial pose and lighting. Among all techniques for
* deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
* we achieve the highest single-network classification accuracy on the FER2013
  * VGGNet architecture, rigorously fine-tune its hyperparameters, and
    experiment with various optimization methods. To our best knowledge, our
  * SOTA single-network accuracy of 73.28 % on FER2013 without extra training
