* bilingual dictionaries were created for all language pairs by running
  automatic word alignment on the entire parallel data set created in the
  previous step. We used GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the symmetrization
  heuristics (grow-diag-final-and) implemented in Moses (Koehn et al., 2007)
  to extract probabilistic phrase tables used in statistical machine
  translation.  These word alignments are also freely available from OPUS (
  http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2011/wordalign/ ).
