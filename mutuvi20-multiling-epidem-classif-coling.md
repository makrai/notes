# Abstract 

* Multilingual text classification models tend to
  * perform differently across different languages (low-or high-resource), 
  * esp when the dataset is highly imbalanced, which is the case for
    epidemiological datasets.  We conduct a comparative study of different
    machine and deep learning text classification models using a
* dataset comprising news articles related to epidemic outbreaks from
  * six languages, four low-resourced and two high-resourced, in order to
  * analyze the influence 
    * language, the struct of the doc, and the size of the data. Our findings
* models based on fine-tuned language models exceeds by more than 50% the
  chosen baseline models that include a specialized epidemiological news
  surveillance system and several machine learning models.  Also
  * low-resource languages are highly influenced not only by the typology of
    the languages on which the models have been pre-trained or/and fine-tuned
    but also by their size. Furthermore, we discover that
  * the beginning and the end of documents provide the most salient features
  * performance of the models was proportionate to the training data size.
