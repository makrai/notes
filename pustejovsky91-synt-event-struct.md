# 1 Intro

* important role of structured lexical representations in natural language, for
  * argument structure as a distinct level of representation
    (Grimshaw, 1990; Williams, 1981) and the importance of semantic
  * f-structure (Bresnan, 1982) and
  * lexical conceptual structure (LCS, Jackendoff 1983; Rappaport & Levin, 1988)
  * we posit event structures associated with predicates and their arguments.
* arg struct
  * conventional: set of arguments and diacritics indicating how they are realiz
  * Some authors: a structured representation over which prominence relations
* events (e.g., whether a sentence denotes an activity, a state, etc.)
  * conventional: a single, existentially quantified event variable for
    sentences in the language (Higginbotham, 1985; Parsons, 1985).
  * There are many who still argue that events are not necessary type
    (Cresswell, 1985)
  * we will argue that grammatical phenomena do in fact make reference to the
    internal structure of events
    * subeventual analysis for predicates is able to systematically capture
      these effects
* basic assumptions of the theory are as follows: (I)
  1. A subeventual structure for predicates provides a template for
    verbal decomposition and lexical semantics. Following
    * Vendler (1967), Dowty (1979), and others, we distinguish three event types
      states, processes, and transitions, where
      a predicate in the language by default denotes one particular event type.
    * we assume a more complex subeventual structure of event types, where
      event types make reference to other embedded types.  
  2. By examining the substructure of events, one can
    describe much of the behavior of adverbial modification
    in terms of scope assignment within an event structure.
  3. The semantic arguments within an event structure expression
    can be mapped onto argument structure in systematic and predictable ways.
    * The event structure proposed here 
      a further refinement of the semantic responsibilities within an LCS
      (Jackendoff, 1983; Rappaport & Levin, 1988).
* one caveat about the analysis presented below. This paper is not the proper
  * not specifying the formal semantics of the event structure proposed here.
  * what we attempt to show is the relevance of event structure to lexical sem
  * Where appropriate, we will briefly point out the
    technical details of the analysis, as well as the
    limitations and shortcomings of the proposal.
    Details of the formal interpretation can be found in Pustejovsky (1991)

# 2 Event types 1

* Temporal aspect
  * sets of periods 
  * initial, internal, and final temporal subperiods,
    as they relate to the semantic roles associated with the arguments of
    (1) a. Mary walked.
        b. Mary walked to the store.
        c. Mary walked for 30 minutes.
* at least three aspectual types: state, process, and events,
  * sometimes distinguishing between accomplishment and achievement events
  * process eg _walk_: an activity of indefinite length. That
    * no information regarding the temporal extent of the activity. Such a
    * (Dowty, 1979; Kenny, 1963; Mourelatos, 1978; Ryle, 1949; Vendler, 1967;
      Verkuyl, 1989). Sentence (1b) conveys at least as much information
  * accomplishment, event or ~, (1b)
    * the process has a logical culmination or duration, such that the activity
  * bounded process, (1c)
    * no explicit mention of a logical culmination to the activity, but rather
      a durative adverbial is used to impose a temporal specification 
* These examples illustrate the same verb being used for three different aspects
  * process, accomplishment, and bounded process
  * When _walk_ appears alone structurally, it assumes a process interpretation
  * lexical accomplishments: build and destroy, in their typical transitive use
* test for whether a sentence denotes an accomplishment: _in an hour_
  * frame adverbials
  * both ‘‘derived’’ and lexical accomplishments license such modification: (3)
* build (lexically accomplishment) can be used in a context where it is process
  (4) Mary built houses for four years.
  * reinterpreted as a process due to the bare plural in object position
    (Bach, 1986; Krifka, 1987).
* achievement
  * like accomplishment: results in a change of some sort, just as an
  * the change occurring instantaneously, eg _die, find, arrive_
  * modification by point adverbials such as _at noon_ is a diagno (Dowty, 1979)
* What are apparently lexical properties of the verb
  can be affected by factors that could not possibly be lexical. For instance,
  * eg (6) accomplishment as in (6a) to a process as in (6b):
    (6) a,b Mary drank (a) beer.
  * bare plural object shifts the interpretation of a logically culminating
    event to an unbounded process
    (Pelletier & Schubert (1989) and Krifka (1987))
* states, such as those sentences in (7):
  (7) a. Mary is sick.
      b. Mary believes that John loves her.
  * no change, no initial or final periods: homogeneity 
  * diagnostics. 
    * allow modification by durative adverbials (8a), and secondly, they do
    * not appear as imperatives (8b) (Dowty, 1979):
      b. `*`Be sick!
* a few more diagnostics. One well-known test for distinguishing
  * activities vs accomplishments, known as the ‘‘imperfective paradox’’
    (Bach, 1986; Dowty, 1979)
    * NP is V-ing ?entails NP has V-en
    (9) John is running => has run.  John is building a house !=> has built a ho
    * whether an action is homogeneous or has a culmination of some sort.
    * a: John has already engaged in some running. Sentence (9b), on the other
    * if x is V-ing entails x has V-ed, then
      either the verb or the predicate is a process
    * A theory of aspect should be able to account for this behavior, and
      not just use it to classify propositions into aspectual types.
  * accomplishments vs non-accomplishments based on scalar adverbs eg _almost_ 
    (10) John almost swam/painted a picture/arrived/left
    a: almost performed an activity of swimming, but did not even begin it.
    b allows for two interpretations. One is similar to (10a), where John
      * other interpretation is that John was painting but did not complete the
    c like (10a) is unambiguous, while
    d permits two readings along the same lines as (10b). Why should there be
  * Dowty (1979) claims that an ambiguity <=> accomplishment
* Summ: the following categorization of aspectual types for verbs and VPs
  * Processes: walk, run 
  * Accomplishments: build, destroy 
  * Achievements: die, find, arrive 
  * States: sick, know, love, resemble
* If aspectual type is viewed as a projection of the lexical properties of the V
  * how is it that the aspectual properties of a sentence may change
    as the result of other factors, such as
    adverbials (both durative and frame),
    the structure of the NP in an arg position (eg  definite vs.  bare plural),
    or the presence of a prepositional phrase?
  * come to be known as ‘‘type-shifting’’ phenomena (Bach, 1986),
  * we will explain them in terms of a configurational theory of event struct
    * how the tests normally used as diagnostics for asp type fall out
      as the principled consequence of different event structures. Thus, we are
    * abandon the feature-based approach to aspect which is generally assumed
      (e.g., Verkuyl, 1972)
      in favor of a restricted, topological theory of how events are structured

# 3 Towards a model of lexical knowledge 5

* the basic requirements for a theory of lexical semantics should be. We present
  * a conservative approach to decomposition, where
    lexical items are minimally decomposed into structured forms (or templates)
    rather than sets of features. We will provide a
  * generative framework for the composition of lexical meanings, thereby
    defining the well-formedness conditions for semantic expressions in a
* two distinct approaches to the study of word meaning:
  * primitive-based theories and relation-based theories. Those advocating
* primitives 
  * word meaning can be exhaustively defined in terms of a fixed set of primitiv
    (Jackendoff, 1972; Katz, 1972; Lakoff, 1971; Schank, 1975; Wilks, 1975).
  * Inferences are made through the primitives into which a word is decomposed. In
* relation-based theory of word meaning claims that there is
  * no need for the decomposition of word meaning into primitives if
  * words are associated through a network of explicitly defined links
    (Brachman 1979; Carnap 1956; Collins & Quillian 1969; Fodor 1975;
     Quillian 1968)
    * link Sometimes referred to as meaning postulates, these links
      * establish any inference between words
        as an explicit part of a network of word concepts. 3 What we would like
* we propose a new way of viewing primitives
  * more at the generative or compositional aspects of lexical semantics,
    rather than the decomposition of words into specified primitives.
* approaches to lexical semantics making use of primitives can be characterized
  * using some form of feature-based semantics, since
    the meaning of a word is essentially decomposable into a set of features
    (Katz, 1972; Katz and Fodor, 1963; Schank, 1975; Wilks, 1975)
  * provide a characterization for all of the well-formed expressions in the l?
    * not Even those theories that rely on some internal structure for word mean
      (e.g., Dowty, 1979; Fillmore, 1988) do
    * Jackendoff (1983) comes closest, but falls short of a comprehensive
      semantics for all categories in language. No existing framework, in my
* What, exactly, would a method for lexical decomposition tell us?
  * Instead of a taxonomy of the concepts in a language, categorized by
  * minimal semantic behavior of a lexical item. Furthermore,
  * the compositional properties of a word, just as a grammar informs us of the
  * a generative theory of word meaning,
    but one very different from the generative semantics of the 1970s
    (Pustejovsky, 1991)
* lex decomp why in a generative fashion
  rather than the traditional exhaustive approach, let me take as a classic
  * eg _closed_ as used in (12) (see Lakoff, 1970):
    (12) a. The door is closed. 
         b. The door closed.      (inchoative)
         c. John closed the door. (causative)
* Lakoff (1970), Jackendoff (1972), and others have suggested that
  the sense in (12c) must incorporate something like cause-to-become-not-open
  * _give_ specifies a transfer from one person to another, e.g. cause-to-have.
  * decomposition theories of word meaning (with a set of primitives) are
    exhaustive since they assume that
    with a fixed number of primitives complete definitions of lexical meaning
* lexical (and conceptual) decomposition generatively. Rather than assuming a
  * let us assume a fixed number of generative devices constructing sem exprs.
  * Just as a formal language is described in terms of the productions 
    rather than its accompanying vocabulary, a semantic language should be
  * in computational linguistics. Different people have distinct primitives for
    their own domains
    * lexical semantics should provide a method for the decomposition
* A minimal decomposition of the word closed is that
  it introduces an opposition of terms: closed and not-closed.
  * both terms in this opposition are predicated of different subevents
    denoted by the sentences. In (12a), this opposition is left implicit,
  * Any minimal analysis of the semantics of a lexical item can be termed a
    generative operation, since it operates on the predicate(s) already
  * draws on Aristotle ’s species of opposition
    (see Categories, 11b17; Lloyd, 1968), and it will form the basis of one
  * evaluate words relative to an opposition. 6
* qualia structure of a lex item
  * The essential opposition denoted by a predicate forms part of it
  * (Pustejovsky, 1989a, 1991)
  * specifies four aspects of its meaning:
  constitutive: the relation between it and its constituent parts;
  formal: that which distinguishes it within a larger domain;
  telic: its purpose and function; eg book: read
  agentive: whatever brings it about eg book: write
* The minimal semantic distinctions of the qualia structure 
  get expressive force when combined with a theory of aspectual (or event) types
  * (12a) denotes the state of the door being closed. No opposition is expressed
  * In (12b) and (12c), however,
    the opposition is explicitly part of the meaning of the predicate
    * Both these predicates denote what we call transitions
  * The intransitive use of close in (12b) makes no mention of the causer, yet
      the transition from not-closed to closed is still entailed
  * In (12c), the event that brings about the closed state of the door is made
      more explicit by specifying the actor involved
  * These differences constitute the event structure of a lexical item
  * Both the opposition of predicates and the specification of causation are
    part of a verb ’s semantics, and are structurally
    associated with slots in the event template for the word. In this case, for
    `formal` role for the verb _close_ is specified as a transition, denoting an
    opposition
    `constitutive` role specifies the exact content of the event, in terms of
    what the predicates engaged in opposition actually are (see below)
    * different inferences and syntactic behaviors assoc with each event type
      (Grimshaw, 1990; Pustejovsky, 1989b)

# 4 A level of event structure 7

* one level of semantic description involves an event-based interpretation
  * other levels: subcategorization, argument structure, and qualia structure.  
* event structure is recursively defined in the syntax 
  => phrases and sentences also have ~
* three primary components to event structure:
 the primitive event type of the lexical item;
 the rules of event composition;
 the mapping rules to lexical structure.
* three basic event types: states, processes, or transitions
  (see Bach, 1986; Dowty, 1979; Vendler, 1967). 9 Except where
  * footnote: Above we distinguished between four aspectual classes. These
    * collapse to three distinct structural configurations, where
      transitions subsume both accomplishments and achievements
  * event structure representing both
    temporal precedence and exhaustive event inclusion
    ie for an event e, represented as [e 1 e 2 ], the intended interpretation is
    * e is an event containing two subevents, e 1 and e 2 , where
      the first temporally precedes the second, and
      there are no other events locally contained in event e. We will
* these event types as follows (where E is a variable for any event type): 
  a. State (S), a single event, which is evaluated relative to no other event 
    Examples, be sick, love, know
    Structural representation:.  S -> e
  b. Process (P), a sequence of events identifying the same semantic expression 
    Examples: run, push, drag 
    Structural representation: P -> e 1 . . . e n
* Following Dowty (1979) and others, we will assume that
  when P is a process verb, then if the semantic expression P 0 identified with
  P is true at an interval I, then P 0 is true for all subintervals of I larger
  than a moment
  c. Transition (T ): an event identifying a semantic expression, which is eva-
  luated relative to its opposition
  (Jackendoff, 1972; Lakoff, 1970; von Wright, 1963) 
  Examples, give, open, build, destroy 
  Structural representation (where E is a variable for any event type):
  T -> E 1 ¬ E 2
(12)  a. The door is closed.
      b. The door closed.
      c. John closed the door.
* assume a level of lexical representation
  similar to that of Dowty (1979), Jackendoff (1983), Levin and Rappaport (1988)
  in that verb class distinctions are characterized in terms of an LCS-like
  structure, which we call LCS 0 .
  * An LCS is a lexical semantic representation
    in the form of a predicate decomposition. Here
  * in terms of
    * no fixed set of primitive terms
    * the principles of event structure outlined here. This level, using
  * predicates such as act(x, y), at(x, y), and on(x, y), constitutes the LCS 0
  * the trees represent LCS-like information
    partitioned according to event structure. Furthermore, we will assume that
* the LCS representations assumed by Levin and Rappaport (1988)
  can be constructed by interpreting the event structure together with the LCS 0
* eg
  * The adjectival form closed denotes a state where the event structure is that
  * a lexical transition, such as close in (12b) and (12c), expresses the
    * interpret the expression of a term opposition as
      logically equivalent to Dowty ’s become operator (Dowty, 1979, p. 140).
    * the operator cause can be seen as a derivative relation between events,
      structurally interpreted from an agentive predicate within the initial
      subevent of an event structure
* LCS
  a.  [closed(the-door)]
  b.  become([closed(the-door)])
  c.  cause([act( j, the-door)], become([closed(the-door)]))
* b and c are transitions from one state to its opposition.  
  * footnote: Hale and Keyser (1986) provide independent motivations for
    treating the inchoative and causative forms of a verb as essentially
    identical at some level of representation
* `LCS 0` representations differ only in the further specification of an
  action being performed for the causative cases; that is, the expression and
* LCS representations do differ significantly because of the explicit
  reference to a causal agent
* Thus, while the verb close is semantically ambiguous at one level (LCS), the
  logical relatedness of the verb ’s senses is captured at another (ES , LCS 0)
* Sentence (17) illustrates process verb structurally
* The sentence in (18) illustrates how a causative process is represented and
  subsequently mapped onto an LCS representation:
* The aspectual distinctions made by the above trichotomy do
  not distinguish between achievements and accomplishments in any structural
  * illustrated above with the inchoative close and causative close, an
    achievement and accomplishment, respectively.
  * Rather, achievements and accomplishments can be distinguished solely in
    terms of an agentive/non-agentive distinction.
  * accomplishments: verb makes reference
    both to a predicate opposition and the activity bringing about this change,
  * achievement: the verb makes no explicit reference to the activity 
* The role of agentivity for distinguishing event types (Dowty 1979),
  replaces the notion of ‘‘event headedness’’ introduced in Pustejovsky (1989b).
  * differ in their event structures eg
    build, draw, and leave
    arrive and die
* hE, an agentive role does seem implicit in many achievement predicates. For
  * eg the sentences in (21) seem to involve an agent:
    (21) a. Mary arrived at the party.
         b. John won the race.
* is agency part of the verbal semantics of arrive and win
  or is contributed by other means, for example, the animacy of the subject, or
  pragmatic effects.
  * agency is not intrinsically part of the verb ’s meaning is not as
  * absence of agency in the sentences in (22), with the same verbs as in (21):
    (22) a. The package arrived at the office.
         b. Our anniversary has finally arrived.
         c. Mary won the lottery.
     LCS: become([at(the-package, the-office)])
  * intentional adverbials such as _deliberately_ cannot felicitously modify
    predicates such as win and die.
(23) a. `*`Mary won the race deliberately. (But cf. Mary lost the race delibera)
     b. `*`Mary deliberately died of cancer.44
* summ
  * agentivity completes the distinctions between the conventional aspec classes
  * Configurationally, as event structures the two classes are identical.
