The Syntax of Event Structure
James Pustejovsky
Cognition 41 (1991): 47–81 # 1991 Elsevier

# 1 Intro

* important role of structured lexical representations in natural language, eg
  * argument structure as a distinct level of representation
    (Grimshaw, 1990; Williams, 1981)
  * f-structure (Bresnan, 1982) and
  * lexical conceptual structure (LCS, Jackendoff 1983; Rappaport & Levin, 1988)
  * we posit event structures associated with predicates and their arguments
* arg struct
  * conventional: set of arguments and diacritics indicating how they are realiz
  * Some authors: a structured representation with prominence relations
* events (e.g., whether a sentence denotes an activity, a state, etc.)
  * conventional: a single, existentially quantified event variable for sentencs
    (Higginbotham, 1985; Parsons, 1985)
  * There are many who still argue that events are not a necessary type
    (Cresswell, 1985)
  * we will argue that grammatical phenomena make reference
    to the internal structure of events
    * subeventual analysis for predicates is able to systematically capture
      these effects
* basic assumptions of the theory
  1. A subeventual structure for predicates
    provides a template for verbal decomposition and lexical semantics
    * Vendler (1967), Dowty (1979): distinguish three event types
      states, processes, and transitions
      * a predicate in the language by default denotes one particular event type
    * we assume a more complex subeventual structure of event types, where
      event types make reference to other embedded types
  2. By examining the substructure of events, one can
    describe much of the behavior of adverbial modification
    in terms of scope assignment within an event structure
  3. The semantic arguments within an event structure expression
    can be mapped onto argument structure in systematic and predictable ways
    * The event structure proposed here is
      a further refinement of the semantic responsibilities within an LCS
      (Jackendoff, 1983; Rappaport & Levin, 1988)
* one caveat about the analysis presented below
  * not specifying the formal semantics of the event structure proposed here
  * what we attempt to show is the relevance of event structure to lexical sem
  * Where appropriate, we will briefly point out the
    technical details of the analysis, as well as the
    limitations and shortcomings of the proposal
  * Details of the formal interpretation can be found in Pustejovsky (1991)

# 2 Event types 1

* Temporal aspect
  * sets of periods
  * initial, internal, and final temporal subperiods,
    as they relate to the semantic roles associated with the arguments of
    (1) a. Mary walked
        b. Mary walked to the store
        c. Mary walked for 30 minutes
* at least three aspectual types: state, process, and events,
  * sometimes distinguishing between accomplishment and achievement events
  * process eg _walk_: an activity of indefinite length
    * no information regarding the temporal extent of the activity
      (Dowty, 1979; Kenny, 1963; Mourelatos, 1978; Ryle, 1949; Vendler, 1967;
      Verkuyl, 1989)
  * accomplishment or event (1b)
    * the process has a logical culmination or duration
  * bounded process, (1c)
    * no explicit mention of a logical culmination to the activity, but rather
      a durative adverbial is used to impose a temporal specification
* These examples illustrate the same verb being used for three different aspects
  * process, accomplishment, and bounded process
  * When _walk_ appears alone structurally, it assumes a process interpretation
  * lexical accomplishments: build and destroy, in their typical transitive use
* test for whether a sentence denotes an accomplishment: _in an hour_
  * called _frame adverbials_
  * both ‘‘derived’’ and lexical accomplishments license such modification: (3)
* _build_ (lexically accomplishm) can be used in a context where it is process
  (4) Mary built houses for four years
  * reinterpreted as a process due to the bare plural in object position
    (Bach, 1986; Krifka, 1987)
* achievement
  * like accomplishment: results in a change of some sort
  * the change occurring instantaneously, eg _die, find, arrive_
  * modification by point adverbials such as _at noon_ is a diagno (Dowty, 1979)
* What are apparently lexical properties of the verb
  can be affected by factors that are not lexical
  * eg (6) accomplishment as in (6a) to a process as in (6b):
    (6) a,b Mary drank (a) beer
  * bare plural object shifts the interpretation
    from a logically culminating event to an unbounded process
    (Pelletier & Schubert (1989) and Krifka (1987))
* states, such as those sentences in (7):
  (7) a. Mary is sick
      b. Mary believes that John loves her
  * no change, no initial or final periods: homogeneity
  * diagnostics
    * allow modification by durative adverbials (8a), and
    * not appear as imperatives (8b) (Dowty, 1979):
      b. `*`Be sick!
* a few more diagnostics
  * activities vs accomplishments, known as the ‘‘imperfective paradox’’
    (Bach, 1986; Dowty, 1979)
    * NP is V-ing ?entails NP has V-en
    (9) John is running => has run.  John is building a house !=> has built a ho
    * whether an action is homogeneous or has a culmination of some sort
    * a: John has already engaged in some running <-> Sentence (9b)
    * if x is V-ing entails x has V-ed, then
      either the verb or the predicate is a process
    * A theory of aspect should be able to account for this behavior, and
      not just use it to classify propositions into aspectual types
  * accomplishments vs non-accomplishments based on scalar adverbs eg _almost_
    (10) John almost swam/painted a picture/arrived/left
    a: almost performed an activity of swimming, but did not even begin it
    b allows for two interpretations. One is similar to (10a)
      * other interpretation is that John was painting but did not complete it
    c like (10a) is unambiguous, while
    d permits two readings along the same lines as (10b)
  * Dowty (1979): ambiguity <=> accomplishment
* Summ: the following categorization of aspectual types for verbs and VPs
  * Processes: walk, run
  * Accomplishments: build, destroy
  * Achievements: die, find, arrive
  * States: sick, know, love, resemble
* If aspectual type is viewed as a projection of the lexical properties of the V
  * how is it that the aspectual properties of a sentence may change
    as the result of other factors, such as
    adverbials (both durative and frame),
    the structure of the NP in an arg position (eg definite vs. bare plural),
    or the presence of a prepositional phrase?
  * come to be known as ‘‘type-shifting’’ phenomena (Bach, 1986),
  * we will explain them in terms of a configurational theory of event struct
    * how the tests normally used as diagnostics for asp type fall out as the
      principled consequence of different event structures
    * abandon the feature-based approach to aspect generally assumed
      (Verkuyl, 1972)
      in favor of a restricted, topological theory of how events are structured

# 3 Towards a model of lexical knowledge 5

* the basic requirements for a theory of lexical semantics
  * a conservative approach to decomposition, where
    lexical items are minimally decomposed into structured forms (or templates)
    rather than sets of features
  * generative framework for the composition of lexical meanings, thereby
    defining the well-formedness conditions for semantic expressions
* two approaches to the study of word meaning:
  * primitive-based theories and relation-based theories
  * primitives
    * word meaning can be exhaustively defined in terms of a fixed set of primit
      (Jackendoff, 1972; Katz, 1972; Lakoff, 1971; Schank, 1975; Wilks, 1975)
    * Inferences are made through the primitives into which a word is decomposed
  * relation-based theory of word meaning
    * no need for the decomposition of word meaning into primitives
    * words are associated through a network of explicitly defined links
      (Brachman 1979; Carnap 1956; Collins & Quillian 1969; Fodor 1975;
       Quillian 1968)
    * links Sometimes referred to as meaning postulates, these links
      * establish any inference between words
        as an explicit part of a network of word concepts
* we propose a new way of viewing primitives
  * more at the generative or compositional aspects of lexical semantics,
    rather than the decomposition of words into specified primitives
* approaches to lexical semantics making use of primitives
  * using some form of feature-based semantics, since
    the meaning of a word is essentially decomposable into a set of features
    (Katz, 1972; Katz and Fodor, 1963; Schank, 1975; Wilks, 1975)
  * provide a characterization for all of the well-formed expressions in the l?
    * not Even those theories that rely on some internal structure for word mean
      (e.g., Dowty, 1979; Fillmore, 1988)
    * Jackendoff (1983) comes closest, but
      no comprehensive semantics for all categories in language
* What, exactly, would a method for lexical decomposition tell us?
  * Instead of a taxonomy of the concepts in a language
  * minimal semantic behavior of a lexical item
  * the compositional properties of a word, just as a grammar informs us
  * a generative theory of word meaning,
    but one very different from the generative semantics of the 1970s
    (Pustejovsky, 1991)
* lex decomp why in a generative fashion
  rather than the traditional exhaustive approach
  * eg _closed_ as used in (12) (see Lakoff, 1970):
    (12) a. The door is closed
         b. The door closed.      (inchoative)
         c. John closed the door. (causative)
    * Lakoff (1970), Jackendoff (1972):
      the sense in (12c) must incorporate sg like cause-to-become-not-open
  * _give_ specifies a transfer from one person to another, e.g. cause-to-have
  * decomposition theories of word meaning (with a set of primitives) are
    exhaustive since they assume
    with a fixed number of primitives complete definitions of lexical meaning
* lexical (and conceptual) decomposition generatively
  * let us assume a fixed number of generative devices constructing sem exprs
  * Just as a formal language is described in terms of the productions
    rather than its accompanying vocabulary
  * in computational linguistics. Different people have distinct primitives for
    their own domains
    * lexical semantics should provide a method for the decomposition
* A minimal decomposition of the word _closed_ is that
  it introduces an opposition of terms: closed and not-closed
  * both terms in this opposition are predicated of different subevents
    denoted by the sentences. In (12a), this opposition is left implicit,
  * Any minimal analysis of the semantics of a lexical item can be termed a
    generative operation, since it operates on the predicate(s) already
  * draws on Aristotle’s species of opposition
    (see Categories, 11b17; Lloyd, 1968)
  * evaluate words relative to an opposition
* qualia structure of a lex item
  * The essential opposition denoted by a predicate forms part of it
  * (Pustejovsky, 1989a, 1991)
  * specifies four aspects of its meaning:
    * constitutive: the relation between it and its constituent parts;
    * formal: that which distinguishes it within a larger domain;
    * telic: its purpose and function; eg book: read
    * agentive: whatever brings it about; eg book: write
* The minimal semantic distinctions of the qualia structure
  get expressive force when combined with a theory of aspectual (or event) types
  * (12a) denotes the state of the door being closed. No opposition is expressed
  * In (12b) and (12c), however,
    the opposition is explicitly part of the meaning of the predicate
    * Both these predicates denote what we call transitions
  * The intransitive use of close in (12b) makes no mention of the causer, yet
    the transition from not-closed to closed is still entailed
  * In (12c), the event that brings about the closed state of the door is made
    more explicit by specifying the actor involved
  * These differences constitute the event structure of a lexical item
  * Both the opposition of predicates and the specification of causation are
    part of a verb’s semantics, and are structurally
    associated with slots in the event template for the word
    * `formal` role for the verb _close_: specified as
      a transition, denoting an opposition
    * `constitutive` role specifies the exact content of the event,
      in terms of what the predicates engaged in opposition are (see below)
    * different inferences and syntactic behaviors assoc with each event type
      (Grimshaw, 1990; Pustejovsky, 1989b)

# 4 A level of event structure 7

* one level of semantic description involves an event-based interpretation
  * other levels: subcategorization, argument structure, and qualia structure
* event structure is recursively defined in the syntax
  => phrases and sentences also have ~
* three primary components to event structure:
  * the primitive event type of the lexical item;
  * the rules of event composition;
  * the mapping rules to lexical structure
* three basic event types: states, processes, or transitions
  (see Bach, 1986; Dowty, 1979; Vendler, 1967)
  * footnote: Above we distinguished between four aspectual classes
    * collapse to three structural configurations, where
      transitions subsume both accomplishments and achievements
  * event structure representing both
    temporal precedence and exhaustive event inclusion
    ie for an event e, represented as [e 1 e 2 ], the intended interpretation is
    * e is an event containing two subevents, e 1 and e 2 , where
      the first temporally precedes the second, and
      there are no other events locally contained in event e
* event types as follows (where E is a variable for any event type):
  1. State (S), a single event, which is evaluated relative to no other event
    eg, be sick, love, know
    Structural representation:.  S -> e
  1. Process (P), a sequence of events identifying the same semantic expression
    eg: run, push, drag
    Structural representation: P -> e 1 ... e n
    * Following Dowty (1979) and others, we will assume that
      when P is a process verb, then
        if the sem expression P 0 identified with P is true at an interval I,
        then P 0 is true for all subintervals of I larger than a moment
  1. Transition (T): an event identifying a semantic expression, which is
    evaluated relative to its opposition
    (Jackendoff, 1972; Lakoff, 1970; von Wright, 1963)
    eg, give, open, build, destroy
    Structural representation (where E is a variable for any event type):
    T -> E 1 ¬ E 2
(12)  a. The door is closed
      b. The door closed
      c. John closed the door
* LCS' := a level of lexical representation in that
  verb class distinctions are characterized in terms of an LCS-like structure
  * similar to that of Dowty (1979), Jackendoff (1983), Levin & Rappaport (1988)
  * An LCS is a lexical semantic representation
    in the form of a predicate decomposition
  * in terms of
    * no fixed set of primitive terms
    * the principles of event structure outlined here
  * predicates such as act(x, y), at(x, y), and on(x, y), constitutes the LCS'
  * the trees represent LCS-like information
    partitioned according to event structure (ES)
* the LCS representations assumed by Levin and Rappaport (1988)
  can be constructed by interpreting the event structure together with the LCS'
* eg
  * The adjectival form _closed_ denotes a state
  * a lexical transition, such as close in (12b) and (12c)
    * interpret the expression of a term opposition as
      logically equivalent to Dowty’s become operator (Dowty, 1979)
    * the operator cause can be seen as a derivative relation between events,
      structurally interpreted from
      an agentive predicate within the initial subevent of an event structure
* LCS
  a.  [closed(the-door)]
  b.  become([closed(the-door)])
  c.  cause([act(j, the-door)], become([closed(the-door)]))
* b and c are transitions from one state to its opposition
  * footnote: Hale and Keyser (1986) provide independent motivations for treat
    the inchoative and causative forms of a verb as identical at some repr level
* `LCS'` representations differ only in the further specification of an
  action being performed for the causative cases
* LCS representations do differ significantly because of the explicit
  reference to a causal agent
* Thus, while the verb _close_ is semantically ambiguous  in LCS, the
  logical relatedness of the verb’s senses is captured in ES and LCS'
* Sentence (17) illustrates process verb structurally
* The sentence in (18) illustrates how a causative process is represented and
  subsequently mapped onto an LCS representation:
* The aspectual distinctions made by the above trichotomy
  not distinguish between achievements and accomplishments structurally
  * illustrated above with the inchoative close and causative close, an
    achievement and accomplishment, respectively
  * Rather, achievements and accomplishments can be distinguished solely in
    terms of an agentive/non-agentive distinction
  * accomplishments: verb makes reference
    both to a predicate opposition and the activity bringing about this change,
  * achievement: the verb makes no explicit reference to the activity
* The role of agentivity for distinguishing event types (Dowty 1979),
  replaces the notion of ‘‘event headedness’’ introduced in Pustejovsky (1989b)
  * differ in their event structures eg
    build, draw, and leave
    arrive and die
* there may be inplic agentive role in achievement predicates
  * eg the sentences in (21) seem to involve an agent:
    (21) a. Mary arrived at the party
         b. John won the race
* ?is agency part of the verbal semantics of arrive and win
  or is contributed by other means, for example, the animacy of the subject, or
  pragmatic effects
  * agency is not intrinsically part of the verb’s meaning
  * absence of agency in the sentences in (22), with the same verbs as in (21):
    (22) a. The package arrived at the office
         b. Our anniversary has finally arrived
         c. Mary won the lottery
     LCS: become([at(the-package, the-office)])
  * intentional adverbials such as _deliberately_ cannot felicitously modify
    predicates such as win and die
(23) a. `*`Mary won the race deliberately. (But cf. Mary lost the race delibera)
     b. `*`Mary deliberately died of cancer
* summ
  * agentivity completes the distinctions between the conventional aspec classes
  * Configurationally, as event structures the two classes are identical

# 5 Event composition 12

* the basic event structures associated with verbs
* how they interact with other syntactic constituents to form derived event
  representations, that is, the phenomenon of event composition
* two classes of event composition, PP attachment and resultative constructions
* There are several types of syntactic constructions that
  directly affect the event type of a phrase:
  temporal adverbials, adjunct phrases, complement type (e.g., individuated or
  not), and aspectual coercion (e.g., the progressive)
  * we consider only the first two types here (for further discussion see Pus())
* the event type for a sentence need not be the event type of the main verb
  * Category changes may occur because of
    explicit rules for how events can compose and be modified
* temporal adverbials are sensitive to the type of event being modified
  (Kenny, 1963; Vendler, 1967)
  eg, the process verb run can be modified by a durative adverbial, while the
  transition build cannot:
  (24)  a. Mary ran for an hour
        b. `*`Mary built a chair for an hour
  * Conversely, build can be modified by a frame adverbial while run cannot:
  (25)  a. `*`Mary ran in an hour
        b. Mary built a chair in an hour
* one basic principle that accounts for these facts:
  only when an event contains a logical culmination (e.g. it is a transition)
  is it modifiable by a frame adverbial. Why should this be?
  * subeventual analysis for verbs =>
    temporal predicates in the language can make reference to a subevent, or to
    an assembly of subevents denoted by the verb
  * the frame adverbial _in an hour_ requires two events to be present eg, the
    two subevents of build, e 1 and e 2
  * this temporal modifier takes as its argument
    the temporal distance between e 2 and the onset of e 1
  * The logical form for our sentence (25b) then will be something like (25c):
    (25) c. \exists P, S [build((P, S)) ^ agent(m, (P, S))
                                      ^ theme(chair, (P, S)) ^ in-an-hour(P, S)]
  * The last conjunct of this expression, in an hour, can be interpreted as
    * temporal measure of (time of) S – onset of P = 1 hour
  => the other event types (states or processes) are ungrammatical with such adv
  without the ‘‘coerce’’ reading (cf. (25a))
* A second kind of event composition involves the
  interaction of a prepositional phrase with the event structure of a verb
  * cases of PP attachment that change the event structure of the verb phrase
  (26)  a. Mary ran
        b. Mary ran to the store
  (27)  a. John pushed the wagon
        b. John pushed the wagon to Mary
  * both (26) and (27): shift in their event types
  * process has been transformed into a transition
    by the presence of a to-PP denoting a bounded path
  * Chomsky (1957)
    * the grammar allows a syntactic construction to mirror an existing lex repr
    * a general phenomenon in language,
    * in this case, phenomenon = transition
    (see also Jackendoff (1983) and Talmy (1985) for similar points)
  * event composition: When this structure arises from syntactic composition
    * rule: In certain constructions, when
      the verb denotes a process (e.g.  run, push), and
      there is a phrase which denotes a function from processes to transitions,
      then the event type of the entire verb phrase (VP) is transition
    * footnote: This is a slight simplification for illustration purposes
      * prepositions such as ‘‘to’’ are relational event functors,
        applying first to a state, and then to a process, to give a transition:
        i.e. <S, <P, T>>
      * event type <P, T> has consequences for the mapping to LCS as well
      * the event type of the matrix predicate is actually
        treated as an argument to <P, T>
      * mx pred is subordinated in Levin and Rapoport ’s (1988) sense, hence
        creating a ‘‘BY manner’’ expression. For discussion, see Pustejovsky ()
    * this is the same structure carried by
      lexically specified transitional verbs such as build
  * eg (26b)
    * the event type of the VP containing the lexical process verb run
      shifts to a transition in composition with the PP
    * notation `<P, T>` is taken to represent a function: processes -> transits
  (28) T ->
    P         ~~ ran ~~           [run(m)]
    `<P, T>`  ~~ to the store ~~  [at(m, the-store)]
    ES           LCS'             LCS
    cause(act(m), become(at(m, the-store)) BY run]
  * the prepositional phrase is able to project its own event structure,
    the state of Mary being at the store
  * modification by a frame adverbial is well formed eg _...in an hour_
* the preposition _to_ is to be analyzed as
  * denoting a relation between states and processes,
    such that the resulting event type is a transition
  * acts like a function from processes to transitions
    * proposals similar to Hinrichs (1985) and Dowty (1979), PP: prop -> prop
* this construction sets up a
  predicate opposition involving the culminating state introduced by the PP
  * as with lexical transitions
  * Thus, the LCS derived looks like that of a lexically specified causative V
  * for different approach to such constructions, see Levin and Rapoport (1988)
    * rules of ‘‘lexical subordination’’ derive such new word senses
* resultative construction: Similar principles of event composition operating
  * eg 30
  * VP = V + DObj + AdjunctP
  * AdjuP predicated of the direct object, that
    specifies the state the object obtains as a result of an action
  * Simpson (1983) and Rappaport and Levin (1989) discuss the
    connection between resultatives, such as those in (30),
    and the property of unaccusativity (cf.  Perlmutter, 1978)
    * Unaccusatives are intransitive verbs whose subjects behave like DOs of tr
      (see Levin (1986) and Burzio (1986) for details)
  (30)  a. Mary hammered the metal flat
        b. Mary wiped the table clean
        c. The men drank the pot dry
  * Rappaport and Levin (1989) argue that the resultative phrase (e.g. flat)
    can only be predicated of the direct object
    * restriction called the direct object restriction (DOR)
    * We will return to this restriction in Section 7
  * involves a systematic event-type shifting from processes to transitions
  * systematic ambiguity is the result of principles of semantic composition,
    rather than an underlying lexical ambiguity in the verb involved
    * follows the general methodology outlined in Pustejovsky (1989a, 1991),
    * whenever possible, the logical ambiguity of a word should be
      generated by general principles operating in the grammar
      rather than by positing multiple lexical entries
  * Rappaport and Levin ’s (1989) analysis assumes a similar position with
   * we cannot touch on the richness of the problem (Rapoport 1990, t)
  * resultative interpretations arise from a similar event composition rule to
    that proposed for PP attachment above
    * both verbs are underlyingly specified as processes, while
      the adjectival phrase _flat_ has event interpretations as states
    * require no additional special semantic machinery
    * analyzing the notion of stage-level predicate (Carlson, 1977) within
      event semantics as a subset of the states
      * ie stag lev preds = states which can be changed by being acted upon,
        functions that take processes to transitions, i.e. <P, T> =>
    * the resultative construction formally reduces to the type of event
      composition encountered earlier with PP attachment; see (32) below
      (Ingria and Pustejovsky, 1990) for a discussion of the syntactic conseq)
  (31) T ->
    P         ~~ hammer ~~  [hammer(m, the-metal)]
    `<P, T>`  ~~ flat   ~~  [flat(x)]
    ES           LCS'       LCS
  cause(act(m, the-metal), become([flat(the-metal)]) BY hammer)
  * explains why
    * just process verbs participate in this construction, and why
    * the resultative phrase (the adjectival phrase) must be a state
    * explanation logically related to that of other subordinating constructions
      (in Levin and Rapoport ’s (1988) terms), but where the new sense of the
      verb arises out of syntactic and semantic composition in the grammar
* psychological predicates such as fear and frighten
  * how event structure contributes to the
    binding violations associated with the latter set of these verbs
  * Grimshaw (1990) to analyze such violations in terms of event structure
  * how this phenomenon extends beyond this verb class: Pustejovsky (1989b, t)
  * The normal conditions on anaphoric binding,
    according to syntactic-based theories of grammar,
    involve the notions of precedence, c-command, and a binding domain
  * One class of examples that violates this definition:
    * experiencer verbs
    * Belletti & Rizzi (1985), Pesetsky (1987), & Grimshaw (1986)
  * there are two types of psych predicates
    * both with an argument structure of (experiencer, theme)
    1. experiencer expressed as the subject (e.g. fear) and the second
    2. theme expressed as the subject (e.g. frighten)
      * footnote There are of course two readings for ‘‘frighten’’ type verbs:
        1. purely causative (x occasions fear in y), and
        2. the other which is being considered here
          * Pesetsky (1987) : the backwards binding effects obtains only in 2.
  * syntactic behaviour of their members is very difficult
  * fear class behaves as expected by the binding theory
  * frighten class allows violations of the c-command requirement on anaph bind
  * Normally, an anaphoric pronoun must be structurally c-commanded by its antec
    eg (34) or (36)
    * ie an anaphor in matrix subject position is ill-formed, because there is
      no possible antecedent to c-command it as in the fear sentences (33a)
  * exception to this rule comes from the frighten class of experiencer verbs,
    eg (33b, c):
  (33)  a. `*`Each other’s students fear the teachers
        b. The pictures of each other frighten the teachers
        c. ?? Each other’s students frighten the teachers
  (34)  a.  The women fear each other
        b.  The women frightened each other
  (35)  a. `*`Himself fears John
        b. `*`Himself annoys John
  (36)  a.  John fears pictures of himself
        b.  The women frightened each other’s students
  * both classes disallow backward binding when the anaphor is the subject (35)
  * when the anaphor occurs embedded within the subject NP, as in (33b, c),
    binding is permitted with frighten verbs. What allows this?
  * Grimshaw (1986) and Williams (1987)
    * the argument structure of the verb contributes information that
      accounts for the binding ability of its arguments
    * the argument structures for the members of the two verbs classes: (37)
    * distinguished only by a case-marking diacritic: it must appear as a DO
    (37)  a.  fear (Exp(Th))
          b.  frighten (Exp acc (Th))
    * argument command is as important for licensing anaphoric binding as c-command
      (38) Argument command: (Θ1 (Θ2 ... Θn))
        members of outermost lists (recursively) a-command all other arguments
    * two separate dimensions of evaluation (both c-command and argument command),
      => Grimshaw ’s theory can predict the subtle grammaticality differences
  * the theory of event structure outlined above
    provides a well-motivated semantic explanation for the structural distinctions
    * the binding violations are part of a much wider phenomenon
  * the event structure for the frighten/fear verbs is that of a transition/state
    (39)  a.  Type(fear) \in state; object is intensional
          b.  Type(frighten) \in transition; subject is extensional
  * it has long been noted that verbs such as
    fear/frighten are/not stative
    hE there has been little formal use made of this distinction
  * the fear/frighten class introduces an intensional/extensional object
  (40)  a.  Mary fears ghosts/big dogs
        b.  Big dogs/`*`ghosts frighten Mary
  (41) a. The movie frightened Mary
  b. Event structure:
    T ~~
      P ~~  [Exp(m, the-movie) & ¬afraid(m)]
      S ~~  [afraid(m)]
      ES    LCS'
  LCS: cause(Exp(m, the-movie), become([afraid(m)]))
  * underlying LCS' relation of experiencing, within the initial event
  * the experiencer variable Exp might be filled by the binary predicate see(x,y)
  * As Grimshaw argues:
    ‘‘semantic dominance’’ within a predicate
    => licensing of variable binding, for example, anaphora
  * Thus, the repr provides an explanation for certain syntactic effects
    which were problematic when analyzed in purely syntactic terms

# 6 Adverbial modification 17

* event structure provides a natural representation for adverbs as event preds
* there are two types of adverbs: wide-scope and narrow-scope
* The ambiguity exhibited by an adverbial, in terms of behaving as a
  mannerversus speaker-oriented adverb, can be explained in terms of
  different scope assignments of the same adverb. Such a solution is
  possible only if we examine the finer structure of the event being modified
* eg discussed in Cresswell (1985) and Higginbotham (1989) involving adverbs
  such as fatally:
(42) Mary fatally slipped
* Within a Davidsonian analysis, where
  * adverbs are taken as event predicates,
  * the intended interpretation for this use of the adverb is represented as
(43) \exists e[slipped(e, m) ^ fatal(e, m)]
  * ''e was fatal to Mary’’
* more complicated examples where the adverb can also be interpreted as a manner
  * As McConnell-Ginet (1982) points out, the sentence in (44) has two readings:
  (44) Lisa rudely departed
    (a) it was rude of Lisa to depart; stative
    (b) she departed in a rude manner:
* McConnell-Ginet:
  * additional argument to the verb -> manner reading (45a),
  * a more traditional Montagovian analysis for the stative interpretation,
  (45)  a. depart(rude, lisa) ~~ manner
        b. rude(depart(lisa))
* not review the details of McConnell-Ginet’s proposal here but, as
* Higginbotham (1989): McConnell-Ginet has no natural way of accounting for the
  factivity of the construction under both interpretations
  * analysis for such constructions in terms of an event semantics which
  * In the manner of Davidson (1980) and Higginbotham, (1985),
  * quantification over an event variable => first-order treatment of such advs
  (46)  a. \exists e[depart(e, Lisa) ^ rude(e, eˆ'[depart_0 (e')])]
        b. \exists e[rude(e, Lisa, eˆ'[depart(e' , Lisa)]) ^ depart(e, Lisa)]
* a.: compared to the set of departing events, Lisa ’s instance was a rude one
  b.: Lisa was being rude in that she departed (e.g. when she did)
  * another example of theta-identification, which
    results in the conjunction of two attributes predicated of a single individu
  * and theta-marking, which applies the adverb as a function to its argument,
    the verb
* problem; this analysis assumes a variable adicity for the adverb
  * rude takes two arguments in one case and three in another (lexical polysemy)
* we show that the ambiguity results from a structural distinction
  * there is a scope distinction which gives rise to the ambiguity

  * we minimally distinguish between the action of departing and
    the resulting state of being departed
  * a transition, annotated by an act relation => behave like an accomplishment
* adverbs such as rudely, traditionally termed manner adverbials,
  modify a semantic expression associated with
  an event structure or an action subevent
  * both the process of leaving and the entire transition are actions, there
    => two interpretations possible, resulting from two distinct scopes:
    over the process (as in (48)); and ~~ manner
    over the transition (as in (49)) ~~ interpreted relative to speaker and situ
* ie a single one-place predicate treatment of the adverbial
* adverbs are idiosyncratic in their behavior as event predicates. For example,
  * eg slowly in both sentences in (50) refers to the action of walking, while
  * quickly in (51); the manner of action or to the duration of the entire event
  (50)  a. Mary walked to the store slowly
        b. Mary slowly walked to the store
  (51)  a. Mary walked to the store quickly
        b. Mary quickly walked to the store
* if quickly selects for a temporal interpretation, it must take wide-scope,
  since it requires a telic event to measure duration
* _almost_ is One of the diagnostics for aspectual classification
  * accomplishments/non allow two/one readings/ when modified by almost while
  (52)  a. John almost built a house
        b. John almost ran
* Both sentences have an interpretation where the act is intended but never carr
  * (52a) carries the additional reading that the action is started but not comp
  * event structure allows for richer structural possibilities for adverbs as
    event predicates, we would expect a sentence to have as
    many interpretations for an adverbial
    as there are distinct predicates in the event structure
     build = T = P + S
(53)  a.  S[almost(S)]
      b.  P[almost(P)] ~~ intent

(54)       P[almost(P)]
        /      \
      e 1 ... e n
        \      /
         run(x)

* achievements, should be unambiguous with respect to almost
  <= they involve only one distinct predicate in their event structure. As
 (55) a. John almost died
      b. Bill almost arrived
      c. Mary almost won the race
* The only reading: something has occurred without the terminus being achieved
  (56)
  T             ~~  P[¬dead(j)]
  S[almost(S)]  ~~  [dead(j)]
  * footnote: Higginbotham (1989); a scope analysis for the ambigs with _almost_
    * assumes a single event quantification, as proposed in Davidson (1980), and
      => unable to capture the behavior of achievement verbs and adverbial scope
<= non-agentive transitions refer to a single predicate and its opposition
  * the privative term is considered a dependent predicate, and does
    not allow modification by the adverbial
* return to the topic of temporal adverbials. It is interesting
  * further predictions are made by a subeventual analysis concerning
    the scope of temporal adverbial modification. With this analysis
  * we would expect that
    a complex event structure would allow modification by a durative adverbial
    of one of its subevents
(57)  a. John gave Mary the record for the afternoon
      b. The company sent John the book for 10 days

  interactions between LCSs and their mappings to argument structure

* an event structure analysis gives further support to deep unaccusativity
  Rappaport and Levin (1989)
  * Much of our discussion hE will be merely suggestive
  * independent arguments in support of a level of event structure,
    see Grimshaw (1990) and Grimshaw and Vikner (1990)
* how the different event types translate to
  verb classes as defined by their grammatical behavior
  * no direct or predictable behavior for the arguments of a verb as determined
    by its event type alone
  * eg transitions appear to form no equivalence class with respect to gramm beh
  * all the verbs in (62) below are lexically transitions, but fall into
    distinct argument structure verb classes (see Levin, 1989): (62) a
    * The bottle broke. (Unaccusative)
    * Mary broke the bottle. (Causative)
    * Mary built a table. (Creation)
    * The movie frightened Mary. (Psychological)
* processes associated with different verb classes, for example, those in (63):
(63)  a. Mary slept.  (Unergative)
      b. John ran.    (Manner of motion)
* Using a level of event structure, we will argue that
  verb classes such as unaccusatives and unergatives correlate with
  independent principles of mapping from semantics to argument structure
* for unaccusative verbs the subject is an underlying object ("deep unacc" anal)
(A) The semantic participant involved in a predicate opposition is
  mapped onto the internal argument position of the lexical structure
  (roughly the d-structure object position)
* That is, an event structure like that in (64a) is associated with
  an argument structure like (64b):
(64)  a.  T ~~ P S ~~ [¬Q( y)] [Q( y)]
      b. V(y)
* all transitions involve a predicate opposition of some sort. Yet, by itself,
  * fails to distinguish adequately the verb classes in (62)
  Independent of this principle, we argue
* causer and agent are somehow associated with the initial subevent of an event
  structure
  * following Grimshaw (1990) and Pustejovsky (1989a)
  (B) The agentive participant in the initial subevent of event structure
    is mapped onto the external argument position of the lexical structure
    (roughly the d-structure subject)
* The result of both principles A and B applying in the structure in (65a) below
  is the argument structure in (65b) (where an external argument is marked with
  an asterisk):
(65) a.

An analysis in terms of event structure allows us to speculate on just what an unaccu-
sative is, in terms of lexical semantic structure. Namely, an unaccusative is a transition
involving a unary predicate opposition, and nothing else.

Above it was argued that resultative constructions are formed from processes in
composition with a phrase denoting a state. Here we show that the apparent counter-
examples to this generalization involving unaccusatives, discussed by Rappaport and

Levin (1989), are not actually cases of the resultative construction at all, but involve the
addition of emphatic (or manner) adjunct phrases. These cases are the following:
(66) a. The river froze solid.
b. The bottle broke open.

These are not true resultatives, for notice that the predication of the adjunct phrase is
merely an attribute to the state introduced by the transition/unaccusative verb itself.

This becomes clearer when we consider the following data:
(67) a. The river froze in 20 minutes.
b. The river froze solid in 20 minutes.
(68) a. The bottle broke suddenly.
b. The bottle broke open suddenly.

The events in both (67a) and (67b) and (68a) and (68b) are coextensive. That is, it is not
the case that the event denoted in (a) is a subpart of that denoted in (b); rather they
are the same event, with different information being expressed about it. That is, these are
unlike the previous cases where a process shifted to a transition. Thus, in our terms,
the examples mentioned in Rappaport and Levin (1989) as resultative constructions are
not logically the same as the classic resultative construction. If this is the case, then the
generalization that an unaccusative verb is a transition involving a unary predicate
opposition strengthens Rappaport and Levin ’s argument for deep unaccusativity,
assuming that only processes enter into resultative constructions.

To conclude this section, we simply state without motivation three final principles
involved in mapping from event structure to argument structure. For more detailed
discussion, the reader is referred to Pustejovsky (to appear).
(C) If the predicate opposition involves a relation, then both the participants are
mapped onto internal argument positions of the argument structure. Otherwise,
relational arguments are mapped directly as expressed at event structure; for
example, give and put are examples where the culminating state is a relation, and
both arguments are realized as internal arguments.
(D) Any participant in the initial event not expressed by principles (A) or (B) is
mapped onto the external argument position.56

The Language of Time: A Reader
(E) Each subevent must be associated with at least one argument position at lexical
structure.

It is clear from the resultative data and the false reflexive data (e.g. laugh herself silly),
that certain predicates require the expression of a separate, unsubcategorized argument
while others do not, for example, hammer the metal flat (see Simpson, 1983). Principle
(E) requires that every subevent (in this case, silly and flat) be associated with at least one
argument position. In conjunction with principles (B) and (A), the false reflexive NP
serves the function of representing the predicate opposition in the transition, while the
external argument represents the causer in the initial event. Therefore, there must be
both an internal argument (herself ) and a unique external argument (Mary) to satisfy
both conditions. Thus, the reflexive NP acts as a kind of argument epenthesis in the
lexical structure:
(69) ES:

T

P

S

LCS⬘:
[laugh(m) & ¬silly(m)]

LCS:
[silly(m)]
become (silly(m) BY laugh)

Notice that in the regular resultative cases the principles (A) and (B) are satisfied by the
existing argument structure, obviating the need for argument epenthesis.

In this section, we have tried to give some indication of how event structure con-
tributes to the understanding of the mapping between the lexical semantics and syntax,
as represented at argument structure. We have glossed over many details and problems
which might remain, but the general theme is quite clear: the theory of grammar can be
greatly enriched by representations such as those considered here for events. It remains
to examine the limitations and further interactions of this system.
