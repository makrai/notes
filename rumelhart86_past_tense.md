On Learning the Past Tenses of English Verbs

#THE ISSUE

* the exact characterization of implicit knowledge [about linguistic rules]
  * explicit
    * language acquisition is thought of as the process of inducing rules
    * innate linguistic universals.
    * Pinker (1984)
  * we
    * illustration: The regular structure of the honeycomb arises...
    * work with the interactive activation model of word perception
* parallel distributed processing (PDP) models ... provide an alternative to
  the explicit but inaccessible rules account of implicit knowledge of rules
* two kinds of arguments against PDP
  * lack the computational power -> Chapter 4.
  * language acquisition

#THE PHENOMENON

* three stages in the acquisition of the use of past tense by children
  * Stage 1: children use only a small number of verbs in the past tense
    * high-frequency, irregular
  * Stage 2
    * much larger number of verbs, the majority of the words [are] regular
    * wug test
    * comed/camed
  * Stage 3: the regular and irregular forms coexist
    * clusters of exceptions
* Variability and Gradualness
  * sequence of three stages is somewhat misleading
  * suggest that the stages are clearly demarcated
* Other Facts About Past-Tense Acquisition
  * different points in Stage 2

#THE MODEL

* the model is presented, as learning experiences, with pairs of inputs
* Structure of the Model
  * phonological root -> featural X> featural -> phonological past
                                  ^ pattern associator (mint igehálóban)
                      ^ Wickel-feature representation: phonological
  * forms of arbitrary length can be represented
* Operation of the Model
