# Abstract

* Vocal fatigue = the feeling of tiredness and weakness of voice due to
  extended utilization
* we: neural embeddings for the detection of vocal fatigue
  * compare x-vectors, ECAPA-TDNN, and wav2vec 2.0 embeddings
    on a corpus of academic spoken English
* Low-dimensional mappings of the data reveal that neural embeddings capture
  information about the change in vocal characteristics of a speaker during
  prolonged voice usage
* can be reliably predicted using all three types of neural embeddings
  after 40 minutes of continuous speaking
  when temporal smoothing and normalization are applied to the embeddings
* We employ support vector machines for classification and achieve accuracy of
  81% using x-vectors, 85% using ECAPA-TDNN embeddings, and 82% usi wav2vec 2.0
* accuracy score of 76%, when the trained system is applied to a different
  speaker and recording environment without any adaptation.
