* SpeechBrain is an open-source Conversational AI toolkit based on PyTorch,
  focused particularly on speech processing tasks such as
  speech recognition, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, text-to-speech,
* transparency and replicability by releasing both the pre-trained models and
  the complete "recipes" of code and algorithms required for training them.
* This paper presents SpeechBrain 1.0, a significant milestone in the evolution
  * > 200 recipes for speech, audio, and language processing tasks, and more
  * > 100 models available on Hugging Face. SpeechBrain 1.0 introduces 
  * new technologies to support diverse learning modalities, LLM integration,
    and advanced decoding strategies, along with novel models, tasks, and
    modalities. It also includes 
* a new benchmark repository, offering researchers a unified platform for
  evaluating models across diverse tasks.

# 1 Intro

* other open-source toolkits, like NeMo and ESPnet,
  also support multiple Conversational AI tasks, each excelling in different
  applications. 
  * NeMo is industry-focused, offering ready-to-use solutions, but may provide
    less flexibility for extensive customization compared to SpeechBrain, which
  * ESPnet also supports various tasks with competitive performance, but
    SpeechBrain stands out for its comprehensive documentation,
    beginner-friendly tutorials, simplicity, and
    lightweight design with fewer dependencies.
