# Abstract

* based on tensor Tucker decomposition models
* an extra tensor mode is formed
* We design two types of clustering models (Depending on different constraints)
  * PCA Tensor Clustering model and
  * Non-negative Tensor Clustering model [with] different regularizations
* optimization ... based on the alternative coordinate scheme
* experiments ... yield comparable or even better performance
  compared to most recent clustering algorithms based on matrix factorization

# 1 Intro

* trend in tensor decomposition research is to introduce more structures in
  decomposition models
  * Tri-ONTD (Tri-favctor _orthogonal_ non-negative tensor decomposition)
    * Zhang+ [24]
    * discover the common characteristics of a series of matrix data
    * application of Tri-ONTD is to identify cluster structures of the dataset
    * based on the centroid-based clustering algorithms such as ...  K-means
  * applications in image representation

* This paper: a tensor factorization based clustering algorithm DRATC
  (Dimensionality Reduction Assisted Tensor Clustering)
* contributions of this paper are summarized as follows
  1. a Tucker tensor decomposition model with specific core structures
    * centroid tensors are of lower dimensionality along each tensor mode
  2. The standard centroid based clustering algorithms are unsupervised
    * we extend [our] tensor clustering algorithms to semi-supervised learning
  3. both learning stages are [simultaneous]
