# 1 Intro

* Gupta (3) proposed a summarization system for Hindi and Punjabi language both
  so this system is called multilingual summarization system.  Fig. 1. Basic

## B. Stemmer

* Ramanathan and Rao (2003) introduces a light weighted Hindi stemmer which
  works on longest match stripping using human generated list of total 65
  suffixes
* Islam+ (2007) also proposed a light weighted Bengali stemmer based on same
  approach as proposed by Ramanathan and Rao (2003). They used 72 suffixes of
  verbs, 22 for nouns and 8 for adjectives
* Majumder+ (2007) proposed a corpus based stemmer
  * works effectively for the primarily suffixing languages such as Bengali
  * clusters the words with same stem but different variants using distance
    function to find out the stem word
* Saharia+ (2014) proposed a rule based approach for stemming the words of
  Assamese, Bengali, Bishnupriya Manipuri, and Bodo languages. They introduced a
  dictionary of frequent words to reduce the over-stemming and under-stemming
  errors and an HMM model to prevent the errors in special case
* Dasgupta and Ng (2006) proposed a Bengali stemmer which is based on segmenting
  the words according to morphemes discovered in a large annotated corpus
* Pandey and Siddiqui (2008) introduces a Hindi stemmer based on finding
  probabilities for occurrences of suffixes and stem together using EMILLE
  corpus
* Majgaonker (2010) introduced a Marathi stemmer based on suffix stripping rules
  generated by human experts
* Suba+ (2011) introduced two versions of Gujrati stemmer.  One is
  * light weighted, hybrid approach based stemmer and another is
  * heavy weighted rule based stemmer. However, except all these methods,
* No standard tool to stem Indian language words with their effective
  performance in comparison of rich languages is available

# IV the preformance of different NLP tools in summarization

* we have taken four techniques which were implemented for Indian text summ. To
  * we [applied?] these methods for English language and compare the results
* The considered techniques are
  * graph based technique for Hindi text summarization (Kumar+ 2015),
  * a hybrid model for Punjabi text summarization (Gupta and Kaur 2016),
  * Text rank based technique for Marathi language (Rathod 2018), and
  * semantic graph based Tamil summarizer (Banu+  2007). Here, we have

# V concludes with the direction for future works
