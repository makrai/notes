Evidence against linguistic relativity in Chinese and English:
  A case study of spatial and temporal metaphors
Tse Chi-Shing & Jeanette Altarriba (2008)

# Abstract

* English speakers often use horizontal spatial metaphors whereas
  Chinese speakers use both vertical and horizontal spatial metaphors.
* Boroditsky (2001) showed that while
  Chinese-English bilinguals were faster to verify a temporal target like June
  comes earlier than August after they had seen a vertical spatial prime rather
  than a horizontal spatial prime,
  English monolinguals showed the reverse pattern, thus supporting the
  linguistic relativity hypothesis. This ﬁnding
* not conceptually replicated in January and Kako’s (2007) six experiments for
  English monolinguals
* we failed to conceptually replicate her English monolinguals’ ﬁndings:
  both Chinese-English bilinguals and English monolinguals were faster to
  verify the sentences after seeing a vertical spatial prime than a horizontal
  * we replicated Boroditsky’s ﬁndings, in part, for our Chinese-English
    bilinguals
  * hE the similarity in the pattern of ﬁndings
    for both Chinese-English bilinguals and English monolinguals
    argues against the linguistic relativity hypothesis.

# 1 Intro

* January and Kako (2007) reported ﬁndings completely opposite to Boroditsky
  * they collapsed their data across six
  experiments, even though these authors used almost exactly the same
  procedures as she did. We corrected a minor problem in Boroditsky’s
  methodology in our experiment. Yet, similar to January and Kako, we also
  obtained results entirely opposite to what Boroditsky reported for our
  English monolinguals. Although we did replicate her ﬁndings, in part, for our
  Chinese-English bilinguals, the similar task performance in our two speaker
  groups was incongruent with the prediction derived from a strong version of
  the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Before elaborating the details of the
  present study, we ﬁrst lay out some background on this issue.
