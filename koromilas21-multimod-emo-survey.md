# Abstract

* This work reviews the SOTA in multimodal speech emotion recognition methods
  * focusing on audio, text and visual information.  We provide a
  * new, descriptive categorization of methods, based on the way they handle
    the inter-modality and intra-modality dynamics in the temporal dimension: 
    * non-temporal architectures (NTA), which do not significantly model the
      temporal dimension in both unimodal and multimodal interaction; 
    * pseudo-temporal architectures (PTA), which also assume an
      oversimplification of the temporal dimension, although in one of the
      unimodal or multimodal interactions; and 
    * temporal architectures (TA), which try to capture both unimodal and
      cross-modal temporal dependencies.  In addition, we review the
  * basic feature representation methods for each modality, and we present
  * aggregated evaluation results on the reported methodologies. Finally, we
  * future: validation procedures, representation learning & method robustness
