Lexicalization patterns: semantic structure in lexical forms
LEONAKD TALMY
In T. Shopen (Ed.), Language Typology and Syntactic Description (Vol. 3)

* we: the systematic relations in language between meaning and surface express
* we assume we can isolate elements scparately
  within the domain of meaning and within the domain of surface expression
  * semantic elements like ‘Motion’, ‘Path’, ‘Figure’, ‘Ground’, ‘Manner’,
    and ‘Cause’, and
  * surface elements like ‘verb’, ‘adposition’, ‘subordinate clause’, and
    what we will characterize as ‘satellite’
* we examine which semantic elements are expressed by which surface elements
  * This relatinnship is largely not orle-to-one
  * A combination of semnntic elements can be expressed by a single surface
    elemcnt, or a single semantic element by a combinatiun of surface elements
  * semantic elemeuts of different types can be exptessed by the same type of
    surface elenient, as well as the same type by severa1 dif-t‘erent ones.  We
  * a range of typological palterns anti universal principies
