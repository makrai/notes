#Abstract

* [generative] model ... which takes into account the homophily or the
  * tendency ... to associate and bond with similar others, and the mechanisms
* weighted social network model such that the
  * nodes or individuals have F features and each feature can have q values
* two phases separated at Fc. For
  * F < Fc large, homogeneous, and well separated communities can be identified
    within which the features match almost perfectly (segregated phase)
  * When F becomes larger than Fc, the nodes start to belong to several
    communities and within a community the features match only partially
    (overlapping phase)
* quantities [that] reflect this transition: average degree, clustering
  coefficient, feature overlap, and the number of communities per node
* We also [interpret these results in terms of] social behavior of humans
