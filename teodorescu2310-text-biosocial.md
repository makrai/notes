* emo dynamics in psychopathology: the patterns of emotional change over time
  * at an aggregate level, they are indicators of one's mental health
  * traditionally determined through self-reports of emotions
    * hE issues with accuracy, bias, and ease of data collection
* Recently: from one's everyday utterances. Addresses many of the concerns
  * not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED)
    correlate with mental health diagnoses
* we study the relationship between
  tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We find that
  * each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user's self-disclosed diagnos
    * eg average valence was significantly lower
      in ADHD, major depressive disorder (MDD), and PTSD
    * Valence variability was significantly higher
      in ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and
      obsessive-compulsive (OCD)
      but not Paranoid personality (PPD)
    * Rise and recovery rates of valence also exhibited significant differences
