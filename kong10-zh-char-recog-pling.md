# Abstract

* role of phonology in access to word meaning
  * One of the central concerns in theories of reading skills is the
* we: Chinese to examine
  * the extent to which phonology affects Chinese character recognition
* Two naming experiments were conducted with a
  phonologically mediated semantic priming paradigm, and
  the relative frequencies of semantic associates of the targets and their
  homophones were manipulated systematically
* Analyses showed that a semantic associate produced robust priming on target
  naming at 57- and 250-msec stimulus onset asynchronies, but
  * only the low frequency homophones of high frequency semantic associates
    facilitated target naming at a 250-msec stimulus onset asynchrony
* ie the role of phonology is neither obligatory nor efficient in access to
  Chinese character meaning
  * contradicting the key assumptions of the lexical constituency model
* A revised parallel access model that emphasizes visual access to semantics is
  suggested as a more plausible account
