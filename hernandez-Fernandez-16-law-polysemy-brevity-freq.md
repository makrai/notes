Testing the Robustness of Laws of Polysemy and Brevity versus Frequency
2016

# Abstract

* Here we
  * focus on a couple of [laws]: the
    * meaning-frequency law, i.e. ... more frequent words to be more polysemous,
    * the law of abbreviation, i.e. ... more frequent words to be shorter. Here
  * evaluate the robustness of these laws in [new conditions]

# 1 Intro

* Zipfs law for word frequencies can be explained by information theoretic
  models of communication and is a robust pattern of language that presents
  * invariance with text length [9] but
  * dependency with respect to the linguistic units considered [5]. The focus
* the meaning-frequency law and the law of abbreviation
  * modelling efforts ... to explain their origin and ... universality [8]
* In this paper we contribute to the exploration of different definitions of
  word frequency and word polysemy to test the robustness of these ...  laws

  * frequency ... sources
    * CELEX lexical database [3], the CHILDES database [16] and the SemCor corp
  * polysemy, we consider two related measures: the
    * number of synsets of a word according to WordNet [6], that we refer to as
      * we are aware of the inherent difficulties ... (see [12, 15]).
    * the number of synsets of WordNet that have appeared in the SemCor corpus,
    * two extremes: the full potential number ... and the actual number
* we plan to extend the range of data sources and measures in future studies
  (we explain these possibilities in Section 5).
* we ... measures of correlation between the frequency of a word and its
  length/number of synsets
  * remain agnostic about the actual functional dependency [e.g. log]
    * currently under revision for various statistical laws of language

  * significant correlation of the right sign is found in all the combinations
