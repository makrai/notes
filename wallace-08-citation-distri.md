* Redner's examination of complete citation distributions of a century of
articles published in Physical Review and of articles published in 1981 has
notably shown that,
  * for a small number of citations, a stretched exponential ... while
  * power-law behavior dominates at a high number of citations [3, 4].
* cost of high levels of parameterization and cannot explain the whole range of
  the citation distribution, especially the stretched-exponential regime [5,
  6].  Given that most of these studies used age distribution of cited material
  for a given year, by definition, uncited articles were often excluded from
  the analysis. Many models based on citation network growth also fail to
  include the zero-citation case [2, 11]. But if one wants to study complete
  citation distributions, the natural point of departure would be uncited
  papers which, it is often erroneously believed, constitute the majority of
  the scientific literature [12- 15]. Although several empirical studies
  [16-21] challenged this belief using data for a few fields and small periods
  of time, no study has yet measured the changes in scientific articles’
  citedness and uncitedness rates over a long period of time and across fields.
* section 3 presents empirical measures of articles’ evolving
  * “citedness” and uncitedness rates. It also provides empirical measures of
  * mean and median citation rates of articles.
