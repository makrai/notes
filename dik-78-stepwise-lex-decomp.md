# Introduction 5

* If we ask an average native speaker of English what a ‘chair’ is:
  eg. a chair is something to sit on b. a chair is a piece of furniture used
  * in some current dictionary, we find paraphrases such as the following: (2)
* (one of) the meaning(s) of a lexical item is defined in terms of the meanings
  of other lexical items of the same language
* the meanings of some lexical items are more complex than that of others => a
  perfectly reasonable procedure
* one would expect this pre-theoretical common sense to be more or less
  directly reflected in theoretical accounts of lexical meaning
  * hE This is not generally the case
* Katz (1972:40) gives the following combination of semantic markers as an
  approximation of the meaning of chair: `(Object), (Physical), (Non-living),
  (Artifact), (Furniture), (Portable), (Something with legs), (Something with a
  back), (Something with a seat), (Seat for one)` (3)
  * and he adds that “this analysis leaves out a considerable amount of info
  * ie the concept of (Object) might be further analysed as: `an organisation
    of parts that are spatio-temporally contiguous which form a stable whole
    having an orientation in space` and
  * the other semantic markers in (3) could be treated similarly
* eg2 murder, a native speaker would probably answer something like: (5) `to
  kill someone intentionally` and
  * current dictionariegve definitions such as: (6) a. kill (a human being)
    unlawfully and on purpose (ALD) b. kill (human being) unlawfully with
    malice aforethought (COD)
  * On the other hand, an analysis in the spirit of Generative Semantics (7):
    `CAUSE(x, BECOME(NOT(ALIVE(y)))) & INTEND(x, CAUSE(x,
    BECOME(NOT(ALIVE(y)))))`
* this paper: native speakers and current dictionaries may well be closer to a
  reasonable analysis of lexical meaning than the theories of Interpretive
  Semantics (IS) as exemplified in (3), and Generative Semantics (GS) as
  exemplified in (7)
* The argument will run as follows:
  1. certain basic assumptions underlying either or both of the two
     above-mentioned theories will be critically discussed
    * These assumptions will be shown to be responsible for the rather large
      discrepancy between the theoretical analyses on the one hand, and what
      native speakers and current dictionaries commonly do, on the other
  2. a theory of lexical analysis will be sketched which does not incorporate
     these assumptions and consequently does not lead to such a discrepancy
  4. Finally, certain difficulties arising in this alternative approach
* terminology
  * meaning definition: any kind of attempt at analysing the (or some) meaning
    or sense of a lexical item
  * defining predicate: any predicate used in the definiens of a meaning def
  * lexical item: an element of the language described or analysed (ie of the
    object language)

# 1.Some Basic Assumptions 7

* The following basic assumptions play a role in either or both of IS and GS
  * To what extent they are relevant to each theory will be specified below

* Our argument, however, will concern these basic assumptions themselves rather
  than the particular ways in which they have been incorporated in theos
  * 1--3. The defining predicates occurring in meaning definitions (are)

## 1.1 Preds are theoretical constructs belonging to a descriptive metalanguage

* should not be identified with lexical items of the object language

* Semanticists are interested
  * not just developing semantic descriptions for particular languages, but
  * in building a semantic theory which will on the one/other hand
    * define those elements and rules which count as semantic universals, and
    * provide evaluation measures for individual semantic descriptions. If

  * explain how the content of expressions of one language could be translated
    into expressions of another language, were it not for some
    * intermediate vocabulary in terms of which the link between the two
      languages could be established

* problems connected with assumption A1

  * suggested predicates are lexical items of the object languages
    * empirical fact: no advocate of either IS or GS has ever suggested any
      defining predicate to be used in the description of lexical meaning in
      English which was not, at the same time, a lexical item of the object
      lang => statements to the effect that those defining predicates are
      arbitrary labels which could just as well be replaced by any system of
      signs preserving similarities and differences, would seem rather empty

  * redundancy in semantic description
    * meaning definitions should represent the (perhaps idealised) lexical
      competence of speakers of English
    * speakers must obviously know all the lexical items figuring in meaning
      definitions in IS or GS
    * Speakers must know, eg the lexical item _alive_, but according to
      assumption A1 they must also know the defining predicate ALIVE, which
      represents an item from the theoretical vocabulary of semantic theory,
      and so on for any other defining predicate. There is,
    * hE no discernible difference between the suggested predicates from the
      assumed semantic metalanguage, and the corresponding lexical items from
      the object language. Therefore, pending a demonstration which would prove

* an objection of a methodological nature: assuming that defining predicates
  * if no direct correspondences between predicates and the object language
  * two sorts of empty theorising about meaning. In the first place, there is
    * no obvious limit to the number and kinds of defining predicates which a
    * when faced with the objection that some meaning definition does not fully
      or correctly specify the meaning of the definiendum, he can always get
      around this objection by claiming that, although the definition would not
      be quite correct if translated into the object language, it is
      nevertheless correct in terms of the metalanguage employed. In each case,
      neither the advocate not the critic of the analysis have much evidence by

## 1.2 Preds of some particular language are universal (language-independent)

* problems
  * how the notion 'universal set' is to be interpreted in this context

  * sometimes a strong interpretation: all defining predicates are relevant in
    the description of all languages:

> Semantic markers must ... be thought of as theoretical constructs introduced
> into semantic theory to designate language invariant but language linked
> components of a conceptual system that is part of the cognitive structure of
> the human mind. (Katz 1967:129)

  * Sometimes a much weaker interpretation: only a proper subset of the
  defining predicates is presented as relevant in the description of all
  languages:

> Roughly, the semantic categories are those concepts represented by the
> semantic markers belonging to the intersection of the sets of semantic
> categories for particular languages ... (Katz 1966:235)

* strong interpretation, assumption A2 is hard to maintain

Those linguists who have concerned themselves with the semantic description and
  * the semantic system of any one language is heavily co-determined by the
  socio-cultural setting in which the language in question is used. One does
  not have to be an extreme relativist to grant that not all cultures are the
  * at least some meaning differences correspond to cultural differences

  * it is surely implausible that culturally determined meaning differences
  should be solely a function of different combinations of the same basic
  conceptual elements, which in themselves are identical for all human (see
  Lyons 1968:472 ff. and Lehrer 1974:164 ff for discussion)
* weaker interpretation, on the other hand, assumption A2 is rather empty as
  * no attempt has been made to define the limits of the presumed universal set
  from which languages would draw their defining predicates (cf Bach 1968)

  * Without such a specification it is trivially true that all languages draw
  * substantive restrictions on this trivial union set could turn assumption A2

* an argument for the univ nature of defining predicates (Katz & Nagel 1974)
  * (8a) entails (8b) in English, while (9a) entails (9b) in Spanish: (8) a.
  George is a bachelor b. George is unmarried (9) a. Jorge es soltero `single`
  b. Jorge no es casado
  * These entailments, they argue, should not be explained in terms of the
  semantic descriptions of these individual languages, but in terms of the
  ‘universal meanings’ (universal concepts and propositions) which the words
  * not only be uneconomical, but also inadequate, if entailment (8) were to be
  explained in terms of a semantic rule of English relating bachelor and
  unmarried, while entailment (9) would be explained in terms of a semantic
  rule of Spanish relating soltero and no casado. In this way, the fundamental
  common properties of (8) and (9) would remain unexplained

    Their solution would be to associate both bachelor and soltero, and
    unmarried and no casado with identical lexical readings phrased in terms of
    language-independent defining predicates, as in: (l°)a

bachelor, soltero: (HUMAN) (MALE) (ADULT) (UNMARRIED) unmarried, no casado:
(UNMARRIED)

  * a statement involving lexical item Lj entails a corresponding statement in
  which Li has been replaced by Lj just in the case that the semantic markers
  associated with Lj are a subset of the semantic markers associated with Lp
* This hE, is an unwarranted abstraction from the socio-cultural determinants
of lexical meaning
  * Marriage is an exemplary instance of a social institution dependent on
  cultural, juridical, and religious rules which are quite different for
  speakers of different languages (cf. Lehrer 1974:169ff.). The assumption of a
  language-independent concept of marriage, therefore, is hard to accept

* a theory not incorporating the assumptions A1 and A2 still can define a
notion of entailment independent of the particular lexical items occurring in
these English and Spanish examples

  * The alternative theory sketched in section 2 of this paper, though not
  * an appropriate language-independent characterisation of such entailments as

## 1.3 Preds are to be thought of as primitive predicates of semantic theory,

* not further analysable by means of other defining predicates
* With respect to whether defining predicates must be primitives of sem theory,
  * a shift in the position of IS 8 at first, semantic markers were judged to
  be primitives (Katz & Fodor 1963)
  * Later: semantic markers might themselves be complex and internally
  structured, this internal structure to be defined in terms of even simpler
  defining predicates (Katz 1967, 1972)
  * criterion for deciding what types of complex semantic marker would be
  admissible in meaning definitions, or for deciding
    * what the ‘depth’ of a meaning definition might be in terms of the
  * Such a criterion is necessary unless one holds the view that different
  meaning definitions of the same lexical item can be accepted as equivalent,
  as in: (11) a. bachelor: (PHYSICAL OBJECT) (LIVING) (HUMAN) (MALE) (ADULT)
  (NEVER MARRIED) b. bachelor: (PERSON) (MALE) (ADULT) (NEVER MARRIED) c.
  bachelor: (MAN) (NEVER MARRIED)
* Accepting (lla-c) as alternative, equivalent meaning definitions of bachelor
  * multiplies the number of defining predicates (which, given A1, are not to
  be identified with lexical items of the object language) and, more
  * requires rules which specify the internal structure of complex predicates
  eg (MAN): (PERSON) (MALE) (ADULT)
  * These rules, however, would be the exact counterpart of the following
  independently needed meaning definitions: (13) a. man: (PERSON) (MALE)
  (ADULT)
* In work on Generative Semantics, assumption A3 is commonly accepted. That is,
  * the semantic predicates for which lexical items are inserted are treated as
  primitive predicates not subject to further analysis
    * We thus get mappings of the following type: (14) a. ALIVE alive b. NOT
    ALIVE * dead c. BECOME NOT ALIVE die d. CAUSE BECOME NOT ALIVE kill
  * one could, it is true, conceive of an alternative without A3 This
  alternative might lead to mappings of the following type: a. ALIVE alive b.
  NOT alive dead • c. BECOME dead die d. CAUSE die => kill
  * this would require a repeated application of lexical insertion to
  structures consisting partly of abstract semantic predicates and partly of =>
  the mapping of semantic predicates onto lexical items is no longer uniquely
  determined. Thus, according to the alternative procedure,
  * eg we could derive the causative verb _harden_ along two different routes:
  13 (16) a. HARD hard b. BECOME hard => harden c. CAUSE harden => harden (17)
  a. HARD hard b. BECOME => become c. CAUSE become =* make d. make hard =>
  harden
  * It is not clear whether this would be a disadvantage of the alternative
  procedure. On the other hand, the alternative procedure
  * might have the advantage of requiring fewer prelexical transformations

* There are two ways, then, in which assumption A3 can be avoided

  * Katz: defining predicates, belonging to the descriptive meta-language, may
  them­ selves have internal structure
    * imposes a heavy burden on the descriptive language, and leads to a
    doubling of definitions of the meaning of lexical items on the one hand,
    and complex defining predicates on the other. The second approach
  * defined predicates may, in the form of semantically complex lexical items,
  figure as defining predicates in the definition of more complex meanings

    This procedure has certain advantages to which I shall return below

* If, however, a semantic theory does incorporates assumption A3, it faces a
  * every single meaning definition tends to become extremely complex. So
  * how language users could learn, remember, and use so many of them

  * no use is made of the fact that some meanings are defined in terms of
  combinations of defining predicates which form a subset of the defining
  predicates used in defining other meanings
    * rather uneconomical procedure
    * comparable to an axiomatic theory in which defined terms may not be used
    to define further terms. Finally, in a
  * the relationships between the meanings of lexical items are expressed very
  indirectly

* For example, consider a simple statement such as:
  * (18) A robin is a bird
  * This statement is indeed simple in the sense that language
    * users on the average need little over a second to come to the conclusion
    that it is true (Rips, Shoben and Smith 1973).
    * Consider what they would have to do if their semantic competence were
    organised according to assumption A3
    * They would have to retrieve the meanings of robin and bird. They would
    * compare these meanings for all of the defining predicates in them, and
    * find out that the defining predicates of bird form a proper subset of the
    * In order to get an impression of the complexity of this task, I give
    meaning definitions of robin and bird based on their glosses in the ALD,
    assuming for the sake of argument that these are couched in terms of
    semantic primitives (which of course they are not): bird feathered creature
    with two legs and two wings, usuable to fly b

      robin: small, brownish feathered creature with two legs and two wings,
      usu. able to fly, with red breast feathers
  * alternative: the relation between robin and bird is established in a much
  more direct way as is, of course, the common practice of dictionaries

  * the actual definition of robin in the ALD runs as follows: (20) robin:
  `small, brownish bird with red breast feathers`

## 1.4 There are connections between meaning defs and the underly syntax 14

* split this assumption into two subassumptions, namely:
  1. (A4a) The structure of the definiens of meaning definitions is of the same
  formal type as the structures which underlie sentences

  1. (A4b) The definiens of meaning definitions is directly accessible to the
  operation of syntactic rules

* Neither of these assumptions is incorporated into Katz' IS. For example
  * the structure of a meaning definition like (3) is different from that of a
  syntactic structure, and it is not available at the point in derivations at
  which syntactic rules operate
* On the other hand, both assumptions are central to the theory of GS

### 1.4.0 The structure of the definienses is the same as that of sentences

* I shall argue that (A4a) is a very useful assumption if it is interpreted in
the sense that at least the argument structure and the scope of defining
predicates must be made clear in meaning definitions
* accessibility: I do not believe that the evidence is convincing. That is,

* usefulness of (A4a), let us look at the IS analysis of a verb like _chase_
  * Katz has presented several variants of such an analysis
  * I here give the latest variant known to me, from Katz and Nagel (1974:325).
  * Katz and Nagel state that this analysis has the form of a phrase marker,
  this is true only in the sense that
  * the elements of the analysis are presented in a tree structure
  * In other respects, the structure given is obviously diff from a synt struct

(21)  [Activity of X [Natúré [Physical]] [Movement [Rate [Fast]] [Direction
[Following Y ]]] [Purpose [To catch Y ]]]
* problems with this type of analysis
  * the defining predicates are different in status, and only part of the
  relevant differences can be thought to be symbolised by the tree
  configuration.  For instance, (Physical) is a property of the (Activity of
  X), or a specification of the (Nature) of the (Activity of X), but (Movement)
  is rather a specification of the (Activity of X) itself.  Consider: (22)  a.
  the nature of the activity of X is physical b. the activity of X has a nature
  and that nature is physical (23)  a. the movement of the activity of X , .
  b. the activity of X has movement. .

  * some of the predicates are provided with argument variables, but others are
  not
    * (Movement) not specified as (Movement of X)?
    * What are the arguments of (Purpose)? From another discussion in Katz
    (1972:102-3) it appears that (Purpose) is a property of (Activity of X).
    “(Purpose) is preferred to the earlier (Intention), ... It is left open to
    what extent the persons engaged in an activity having a fixed purpose
    themselves have the associated intention.” But could a person be chasing
    another person without having the intention of catching him?
    * Is (Following Y) a property of X, of (Activity of X), of (Movement), or
    of (Direction)? From the tree structure one would think the latter is
    intended, but this can hardly be meant to be interpreted in the sense that
    the direction of X’s movement is following Y
    * Perhaps it should be interpreted in such a way that the direction of X’s
    movement is such that X is following Y, but if this is so, then it should
    be indicated by means of appropriate argument variables
* Generative Semantics provides better opportunities for capturing the logical
properties of defining predicates, since it incorporates assumption (A4a),
  * the structures underlying both lexical and syntactic complexes closely
  approximate the fundamental properties of the formulae of propositional and
  predicate logic
  * much easier to see both the argument structure and the scope relations
  connected with the defining predicates, than it is in semantic marker trees
  with the format of (21), On the other hand, assumption
* (A4b) has been much less convincingly established by the theory of GS. Let us
consider some of the arguments which have been advanced for the thesis that
syntactic rules must have access to lexical structure,

### 1.4.1 Predicate Raising

* McCawley (1968b) has argued that the predicates in the underlying structures
(24) CAUSE(x, BECOME(NOT(ALIVE(y)))) must be grouped into one unit before the
lexical item kill can be inserted: (25) CAUSE(BECOME(NOT(ALIVE))) (x, y)

### 1.4.2 Equi-NP deletion

* the prelexical application of Equi-NP deletion would be necessary in order to
  * to analyse a verb as _look for_ in terms of ‘try to find’, or _malinger_ in
  terms of ‘pretend to be sick’ (McCawley 1968b). But again, (29) TRY(x,
  FIND(x, y)) => look for(x, y) (30) PRETEND(x, SICK(x)) => malinger(x)

### 1.4.3 Scope of'adverbials

* Another class of arguments for the prelexical application of syntactic rules:
when we need sublexical material for defining the scope of certain elements.
* Thus, Morgan (1969): adverbials may modify material which is not present in
surface structure but can be reconstructed from the internal structure of
lexical items.  (30) I almost killed him is judged to be ambiguous between (31)
I almost (did something which) caused him to die (32) 1 (did something which)
caused him to almost die
* This ambiguity would be difficult to account for unless one assumes that the
lexical substructure of kill is available at the syntactic level.  However,
* hE (33) I closed the door temporarily
  * not modify my action of closing the door, but the resulting state `closed`
* McCawley starts from (34) CAUSE(I, BECOME(TEMPORARY(CLOSED(the door))))
  * “it is necessary that there be a transformation which may apply before
  predicate raising and which raises ‘adverbial’ elements"
  * two problems with this approach: first,
    * how do the rules detect which predicate is eligible as adverbial
    * is TEMPORARY a main predicate at all. Literally, (34) would be a. ‘I
    brought it about that it became temporary that the door was closed’ b. ‘I
    made the closing of the door temporary’ This is not
    * A correct paraphrase of the latter sentence would instead be: (36) ‘I
      * it is asserted both that I closed the door and that the closing of the
      door was temporary
  * with 34, we would expect many types of modification to be preserved under
  lexicalisation which are, in fact, not preserved (Fodor 1970)
* In fact, the strongest claim that can be defended is that in certain
exceptional cases we need sublexical material for determining the scope of
certain adverbials
  * If, however, we make all sublexical structure accessible at syntax, then we
  incorrectly treat these exceptions as if they were general
  * we have to formulate a host of restrictions for excluding what is, in

### 1.4.4 Implicit antecedents

* anaphoric reference to lexical substructures. Eg Lakoff (1972:611):
  * a.  The metal liquefied, but it took me an hour to bring it about b. The
  chemist liquefied the metal in an hour, but it would have taken me a week to
  bring it about.
* Both in (38a) and in (38b) the pronoun it refers anaphorically to ‘the
metal’s liquefying’ a/b. antecedent is/not directly recoverable from surface
structure, whereas If we assume an underlying structure of the form: (39)
CAUSE(x, BECOME(LIQUID(y)) then this structure provides us with an explicit
antecedent for it in (38b).
* problems than it solves (cf.  the criticism in Fodor 1970):
  * Anaphoric reference to implied antecedents is the exception
    * a great many possible antecedents provided by the underlying structures
    cannot be anaphorically referred to in the manner of (38b).
  * Anaphoric reference to sublexical antecedents are always more ‘difficult’
  or ‘strained’ in terms of interpretation than is anaphoric reference to
  explicit antecedents
    * not be expected if both explicit and implicit antecedents were available
    in the same way in underlying structure
  * Anaphoric reference to implicit antecedents is possible in certain cases
  where even GS does not provide the required antecedent. eg Fodor (40) John
  married Mary though we were surprised that she would do it Here

### 1.4.5 Conclusion

* None of the arguments in support of assumption (A4b) are strongly convincing.
  * A4b: ie availability of lexical structure to syntactic rules,
  * Predicate Raising and Equi-NP Deletion are necessary only given a
  particular view of lexical insertion which itself is not necessary.
  * Anaphora to implicit antecedents
  * Scope ambiguities of adverbials are no less a problem for GS than for other

# 2.Sketch of an Alternative theory of Meaning Definitions 21

* assumptions:
  * The defining predicates are
    1. lexical items of the object language.  => not drawn from a universal,
    language-independent set of such predicates;
    2. need not be primitives
      * they may themselves be defined in other meaning definitions.
  * definiens
    3. its structure is of the same formal type as those underlying sentences.
    1. not directly accessible to the operation of syntactic rules
* This theory is conceived within Functional Grammar (FG)
  * FG is a model of syntactic-semantic description (Dik 1978)
  * I will briefly describe here those aspects of FG which are essent for lex
* the lexicon plays an im­ portant part
  * contains all of the basic ‘contentive’ lexemes of the language in the form
    * predicates together with a specification of their structural and
      functional properties
* Basic lexemes are those which are not derived or otherwise constructed by
  means of productive rules, Basic predicates are of different types:
  * verbal, nominal, adjectival, and perhaps others. Although
  * they are all predicates, these
  * categorial differences are indicated from the very start, since they are
    needed to determine differences in behaviour with respect to synt rules
* basic lexemes are not given as isolated items, but as a
  part of predicate-frames
  * predicate-frames are structural schemata
  * Each predicate-frame specifies at least the following information
    about the predicate:
    * its lexical form,
    * the number of arguments it requires,
    * the selection restrictions imposed on these arguments,
    * the semantic functions of the argu­ ments,
    * the syntactic type of the predicate. The following example illustrates

(41) give `(x1 human(x1))_Ag (x2)_Go (x3: animate(x3))_Rec`

* nuclear predications
  * The predicate-frames define the basic structure of nuclear predications,
  * indicate sets of states of affairs.  Nuclear predications
  * can be extended by means of satellites, which have
    * the same formal properties as arguments do, but are
    * in construction with the nuclear predication as a whole
      rather than with the predicate
  * a nuclear predication indicating an Action can be extended by adding
    satellites specifying the Manner, the Instrument, the Beneficiary, the
    Reason, the Time, etc. of the Action.
* 45
  * nuclear predication, indicating an Action of giving;
  * followed by a satellite x4 specifying the Purpose of the Action. This
  * the indexed variables symbolise co-reference, and the last argument, x5,
* predicational structures of the form of (45) are further developed by first
  * assigning the syntactic functions Subject and Object to constituents
    already marked for semantic functions, and then
  * assigning pragmatic functions such as Topic and Focus to the resulting
    complexes of functions
* The functional structures resulting from these assignments will determine
  * the syntactic form in which the construction is going to be realised, and,
  * the full semantic interpretation of the construction.
* specification of the meaning of lexical items, we assume that
  * each predicate is associated with a meaning definition
  * The definiendum of that meaning definition is the predicate-frame
  * the definiens is, in accordance with assumption (A4a), of the same
    fundamental type as predicational structures such as (45). Since
  * all the predicates are lexical items of the object language, this will also
  * meaning definitions are incorporated in the lexicon rather than appearing
    in the structures underlying sentences, the definiens of meaning
    definitions is not directly accessible to the operation of syntactic rules,
    in accordance with assumption (A4b').
* what is meant by assumption (A3'), which states that
  * defining predicates need not be primitive, but may themselves be defined
  * we shall try to give the simplest possible meaning definition for each
    lexical predicate. One way of achieving simplicity is to
    * make maximum use of predicates which have already been defined in other
    * <= the principle of ‘stepwise’ lexical decomposition.  This principle is in
      * a more rigorous version of assumption (A3'). Whereas (A3') allows the use
      * requires a maximum use of defined predicates in meaning definitions. We
* (A3`*`) The definiens may not contain a proper subconfiguration of predicates
  such that this subconfiguration in itself constitutes the definiens of a
  meaning definition defining some predicate 0j.
* this definition comes closest to expressing what a native speaker of English
  would probably say when responding to the question ‘What is a eg1 bachelor?’.
* eg2 consider the relationship between _assassinate, murder, kill,_ and _die_
  * a chain of defs, as given in (48)—(51):
  * to assassinate someone is to murder someone who is an important politician.
  * to murder someone is to kill that someone with the Circum­ stance that one
    intended to perform that Action
    * the intention is given as a Circumstantial satellite of the nuclear
      Action schema, specified by a predication schema.
  * to kill some being is to cause a process in which that being dies
    * Notice that the second argument of cause, x3, is specified by means of a
      predication schema.
  * for someone to die is for a process to take place in which that someone
    becomes dead.
  * Of course, there are many formal and substantial points in these definitions
    which would require extensive further discussion
  * Here we are only concerned with how
    the principle of stepwise lexical definition would exclude, for instance, a
    ‘murder’ := ‘cause to become dead intentionally’
    * since ‘become dead defines the predicate die, and
      ‘cause to die’ defines kill
  * Again, these definitions are close to native speakers’ and dictionaries’
    practices in defining lexical meanings

# 3.Some Advantages 27

1. advantages following directly from the underlying assumptions
  * From assumption (A1') it follows that this theory is
    economical in that no semantic elements (complex or primitive) are
    postulated other than those expressed by the lexical items of the language
  * stepwise definition embodied in assumption (A3`*`) also makes for
    * economy in terms of length and complexity of meaning definitions, and has
    * the paradigmatic relations between the lexical items of the language are
      directly expressed
  * Assumption (A4a) has the advantage that the definiens gives us precisely
    the same type of information about the properties of the defining
    predicates and their interrelations, as we get from the structures that
    underlie sentences.
  * Assumption (A4b') has the advantage of explaining why it is that in the
    normal case sub-lexical structure is not accessible on the syntactic level.
* further advantages
  * how we can reconstruct the process of ‘interpreting a sentence’. When
    someone interprets a sentence, at least one of the things he must do is to
    retrieve the meanings of the lexical items figuring in the sentence, and to
    determine how these relate to each other.  This is easily expressed in
    * the meaning specification given by the definiens of a meaning definition
      can always be substituted for the definiendum in the position in which it
      occurs in underlying structure.  This substitution gives a paraphrase of
      the original sentence, which can be considered a first approximation to a
      full analysis of its meaning
    * ie easy expression of paraphrase relations.
    * independent of the actual make-up of these underlying structures. These
* sublexical structure should not be directly accessible to syntactic rules.
  * how to account for those cases in which such accessibility seems
* eg to Barbara Hall in Carden and Miller (1970):
  54 Redwood stumps sprout prolifically and these can grow to maturity
  A mamutfenyő tuskók termékenyen csíráznak, és ezek kifejlődhetnek.
  * on the fringe of being grammatical, and that intuitively it appears to
  * what the antecedent of _these_ is. I believe that it is not unrealistic to
  * interpretation process:
    * first assume that the surface structure of the sentence will provide him
      with some antecedent for these
    * The semantic and the prosodic properties of (54) will soon tell him,
      however, that redwood stumps cannot be the antecedent of these, and he
    * no other overt antecedent in the sentence
    * ask whether there might be something ‘implied’ in _redwood stumps sprout
      prolifically_ which might act as an antecedent
    * The meaning definition of the verb _sprout_ will provide him with such a
      possible antecedent. This meaning definition would have something like
    * to say of something that it ‘sprouts’ is to say that it ‘produces
      sprouts’
    * constructing a paraphrase of the original expression along the lines
    * checking whether this first-order paraphrase contains some constituent
      which might qualify as an antecedent.
    * These ‘sprouts’ implied in the verb sprout would then be an antecedent
  * the marked character of the anaphoric reference as exemplified in (54) is
    explained in terms of a secondary strategy
