* in psychopathology, at an aggregate level, the patterns of emotional change

  * traditionally been determined through self-reports of emotions; however,
    * hE issues with accuracy, bias, and ease of data collection
* Recently: from one's everyday utterances addresses many of these concerns,
  * not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED)
    correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the first time, 
* we study the relationship between
  tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We find that 
  * each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user's self-disclosed diagnos
    * eg average valence was significantly lower in ADHD, MDD, and PTSD.
    * Valence variability was significantly higher in ADHD, depression, bipolar
      disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but not PPD
    * Rise and recovery rates of valence also exhibited significant differences
