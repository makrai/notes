# Abstract

we explore the potential of 
  * pre-trained word embeddings to identify generic types of semantic relations
    in an unsupervised experiment. We propose a 
  * new relational similarity measure 
    * based on the combination of word2vec’s CBOW input and output vectors
    * outperforms alternative vector representations, when used for
      unsupervised clustering on SemEval 2010 Relation Classification data
