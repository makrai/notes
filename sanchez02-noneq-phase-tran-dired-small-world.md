* [statistical physics] ideas and techniques developed in the last fifty years
  * developed ... to deal with cooperative phenomena in many body systems 
  * may be useful to understand emergent complex behaviour in systems
* small-world (SW) networks, recently introduced by Watts and Strogatz (1998)
  * result from randomly replacing a fraction p of links of a d-dimensional
    regular lattice with new random links
  * interpolate between the two limiting cases of a regular lattice (p = 0) and
    completely random graphs (p = 1)
* directed ... links

    food webs, cultural influences
  * Asymmetric synaptic strengths have already been shown to be very important
    in trying to describe the process of learning in realistic neural network
    model approaches to brain function [19,20].

  * [introduce directed small world] 
    * In case only undirected links are used, our model becomes identical to
      the classical Ising model on a standard (undirected) SW network 
      (Barrat and Weigt 2000)
    * find that the existence of directed links completely changes the
      behaviour of the system 
      * from mean-field behaviour (for undirected networks) 
      * to a highly nontrivial and rich phase diagram in the case of directed
        networks
* numerical simulations we find that, 
  * for rewiring probabilities in the range 0 < p < p c
    line of continuous phase transitions from an ordered to a disordered state.
    * phase transitions occur at a critical value of the temperature T_c(p),
      which depends on p. However, 
  * for higher disorder densities p c < p ≤ 1, the phase transition becomes
    first-order. 
* Our results show that, in order to model biological, social or economic
  processes on complex networks, it is crucial to take into account the
  character, directed or undirected, of the corresponding relational links.
