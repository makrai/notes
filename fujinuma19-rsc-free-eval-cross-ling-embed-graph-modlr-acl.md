A Resource-Free Evaluation Metric for Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings 
  Based on Graph Modularity
ACL 2019

# Abstract 

* word similarity should be independent of language
  i.e., word vectors within one language should not be more similar to each
  other than to words in another language
* [network] Modularity
  * strength of clusters  
  * moderate to strong correlation with three downstream tasks, 
  * does not require any external resources. We show through experiments that
  * can serve as an intrinsic validation metric ..., particularly on distant
    language pairs in low-resource settings
