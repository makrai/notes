# Abstract

* we construct and collect four datasets with distinct joke types
  in both English and Chinese and conduct learning experiments on humor recog
* We implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with
  extensive filter size, number and Highway Networks to increase the depth of
* outperforms in recognition of different types of humor with benchmarks
  collected in both English and Chinese languages on accuracy, precision, and
  recall in comparison to previous works

Tab 1: Type: One-liner, Pun, All, Political
