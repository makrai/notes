# Abstract

* techniques from game theory and Bayesian cognitive science to
  formalize Gricean pragmatic reasoning
  (Franke 2009, Frank & Goodman 2012, Goodman & Stuhlmüller 2013, Jäger 2012)
* two phenomena which pose a challenge to these accounts of pragmatics:
  * M-implicatures (Horn 1984)
  * embedded implicatures which violate Hurford’s constraint
    (Hurford 1974, Chierchia+ 2012)
* we propose a realignment of the division between semantic and pragmatic cont
* a novel class of implicature, non-convex disjunctive implicatures
