#Abstract

* supervised disambiguation,
* disambiguate both 
  * contrastive senses such as nominal and verbal senses as well as 
  * nuanced senses such as sarcasm. We further evaluate
* Part-of-Speech disambiguated embeddings on neural dependency parsing,
  yielding a 
  * greater than 8% average error reduction in unlabeled attachment scores
    across 6 languages.

#1 Introduction

* distributed representations ... for a wide variety of NLP tasks including 
  * Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Analogy/Similarity
    Querying, Transliteration, and Dependency Parsing (Al-Rfou et al., 2013;
    Al-Rfou et al., 2015; Mikolov et al., 2013a;b; Chen & Manning, 2014).
* incorporating features such as 
  * character (compositional) information, 
  * word order information, and
  * multi-word (phrase) information (Ling et al., 2015; Mikolov et al., 2013c;
    Zhang et al., 2015; Trask et al., 2015)

##2.5 Clustering convolutional context embeddings

* Chen et al. (2015) 
  * selects the number of word clusters for each word based on the number of
    definitions for a word in the WordNet Gloss (as opposed to other
    approaches that commonly pick a fixed number of clusters)
