# Abstract

* Fatigue results from a series of physiological and psychological changes. Can
  * affect the physiological states of operators, thereby reducing their labor
  * reduce efficiency and, in serious cases, cause severe accidents. In
  * trigger pathological-related changes. By establishing appropriate methods
* Existing fatigue detection methods mostly include 
  * subjective methods, such as fatigue scales, or those involving the use of
  * professional instruments, which are more demanding for operators and
    cannot detect fatigue levels in real time
* Speech contains information that can be used as acoustic biomarkers to
  monitor physiological and psychological statuses
* we constructed a fatigue model based on the method of sleep deprivation by
  * features
    * physiological indexes, such as P300 and glucocorticoid level in saliva,
    * questionnaires filled by 15 participants under 
  * different fatigue procedures and graded the fatigue levels accordingly.  We
    then extracted the speech features at different instances and constructed a
    model to match the speech features and the degree of fatigue using a
    machine learning algorithm. Thus, we established a method to rapidly judge
    the degree of fatigue based on speech. The 
* accuracy of the judgment by sample length
  * unitary voice -> could reach 94%, whereas that based on 
  * long speech could reach 81%. Our fatigue detection method based on acoustic
* can operate in real time and is non-invasive and efficient.  Moreover, it can
