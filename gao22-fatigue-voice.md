# Abstract

* Fatigue results from a series of physiological and psychological changes
  * affect the physiological states of operators, thereby reducing their labor
  * reduce efficiency and, in serious cases, cause severe accidents
  * trigger pathological-related changes
* Existing fatigue detection methods mostly include
  * subjective methods, such as fatigue scales, or those involving the use of
  * professional instruments, which are more demanding for operators and
    cannot detect fatigue levels in real time
* Speech contains information that can be used as acoustic biomarkers
  to monitor physiological and psychological statuses
* we constructed a fatigue model based on the method of sleep deprivation by
  * features
    * physiological indexes, such as P300 and glucocorticoid level in saliva,
    * questionnaires filled by 15 participants
  * different fatigue procedures and graded the fatigue levels accordingly.  We
    then extracted the speech features at different instances and constructed a
    model to match the speech features and the degree of fatigue using a
    machine learning algorithm. Thus, we established a method to rapidly judge
    the degree of fatigue based on speech
* accuracy of the judgment by sample length
  * unitary voice -> could reach 94%
  * long speech could reach 81%
* our model can operate in real time, it is non-invasive and efficien

# Discu

* sleep deprivation modeling is a common method of fatigue modeling
* Speech contains substantial information that can be used as biomarker
  * monitor patient status, diagnose conditions, classify diseases, or develop
    drugs (Abrahamsson 2018; Kraus, 2018; Noffs 2018; Lee 2020; Fagherazzi 21)
* Objective speech assessment is more accurate, replicable, and feasible than
  perceptual analysis (Noffs 2018)
  * changes in the characteristic parameters of the voice pattern are
    closely related to fatigue levels (de Vasconcelos 2019)
* machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence is widely used in speech
  (Dibeklioglu 2018; Delić 2019; Li and Mills, 2019)
  * fatigue level to be rapidly and accurately identified through voice info
    (Dibeklioglu 2018; de Vasconcelos 2019)
* our accuracy rate lies within the range of 76%–81%
* limitations of voice information for fatigue determination
  * insufficient number of participants, females were not included
  * different dialects and age groups were not considered
* A “biological marker” or “biomarker” (Strimbu and Tavel, 2010)
  * Acoustic biomarkers have remarkable potential in reforming diagnostics in
    diseases affecting the heart, lungs, vocal folds, or brain
* speech recognition technology for biomarkers
  * neurodegenerative eg Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and mild
    cognitive impairment (Ahmed 2013; Dashtipour 2018; Toth 2018; Yang 2020)
  * mental health and emotional condition (Pisanski 2016; Holmqvist-Jämsén
    2017; Dibeklioglu 2018; Pisanski and Sorokowski, 2021; Kappen 2022)
  * respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 to detect/monitor the
    * health conditions of the patients and
    * emotional states of the staff
      (Castillo-Allendes 2021; König 2021; Gama 2022)
  * no vocal biomarkers have been approved by
    the US Food and Drug Admin or the European Medicines Agency so far
* future
  * a unified corpus collection standard and a large-scale library of
    clinically available voice samples should be developed
  * algorithm optimization and updates and the
  * integration of algorithms into user-friendly devices
    eg smartphone applications and connected medical devices (Fagherazzi 2021)
