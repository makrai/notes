# Abstract

* Recent evidence demonstrates
  early phonological processes during the identification of Chinese words
  * ? such processes ‘‘mediate’’ access to Chinese word meaning: less clear
* ‘‘phonologically mediated priming’’ with English words that
  * naming time of a target word (eg, sand) is facilitated
    more by a homophone of a semantic associate (eg, beech)
    than by a control (eg, bench) (Lesch & Pollatsek, 1993)
  * we investigate mediation, using this paradigm
* Prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) varied at 129, 243, and 500 ms
* In the 129- and 243-ms SOA conditions, critical results involved the role of
  homophone density in naming Chinese words:
  * Homophones of synonyms facilitated/not target identification
    for primes with few/many homophones
  * Synonym primes facilitated naming in all conditions, but the
    * effect was reduced when primes had many homophones
  * Synonym priming was greater than homophone priming
    across SOAs of 129 and 243 ms
  * At the 500-ms SOA, however, only synonyms facilitated target recognition
* ie phonological information is best thought of as a spreading activation that
  is shared among written units, with mediation, in the classic sense,
  restricted to cases in which this activation is distributed among relatively
  few units
* Implications discussed for
  a model of Chinese reading and the general concept of mediation
