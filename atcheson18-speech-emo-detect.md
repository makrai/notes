* a correlation exists between the time-varying disagreement from independent
  groups of annotators
  * Because the groups are completely isolated except via the speech signal,
    this agreement-about-disagreement demonstrates that
    there is a component of annotator disagreement which arises systematically
    from the signal itself, which qualitatively implies that
    the perceived emotional content of speech can exhibit some degree of
    inherent ambiguity.  Additionally, we show that
* these human annotations exhibit a degree of temporal smoothness
* Neither of these characteristics is represented by the standard
  series-of-means ground-truth model
  => we propose two alternative ground-truth models
    * a mean-variance model that incorporates ambiguity, and
    * a more general Gaussian process model that incorporates ambiguity and
      temporal smoothness in a well-defined probability distribution.
