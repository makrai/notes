Learning sentiment-specific word embedding for twitter sentiment classification
ACL 2014 -

# Abstract

* [only] syntactic context ... is problematic for sentiment analysis
  [because of] words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment
* We address this issue by learning sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE),
* from massive distant-supervised tweets
  collected by positive and negative emoticons.
* Experiments on [a] Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013
