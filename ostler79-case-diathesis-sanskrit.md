# Abstract

* Case is the province of three components of the grammar
  * Case Incidence, whose rules govern the occurrence of relevant morphological
    categories, in particular the Formal Cases, on the basis of syntactic info
  * Functional Structure, which is the framework relating Participant Roles
    (similar to Fillmore's 'Deep Cases') to types of predicate; and
  * Linking itself, which establishes systematic correspondences between the
    morphological categories and the participant roles

# 1 In The three components

* Case Incidence are a part of the syntax
  * They interact particularly closely with Phrase Structure, but
  * the power of these rules goes beyond that of context-free PS rules
    * evidence from Japanese
* functional structure
  * Previous attempts to formulate partial theories for it are reviewed, and
  * a new and more comprehensive attempt is made, which is
    * localist in orientation: Source, Goal, Theme and Path play key roles
  * A system of binary features is introduced, which is intended to map out the
    whole domain, and to provide
    intrins connexions between types of predicate and types of participant role
* Linking principles are shown to be of two kinds, Semantic and Grammatical
  * Semantic linking rules make use of the feature system to establish intrinsic
    connexions between particular formal cases and particular classes of roles
  * Grammatical linking rules presuppose total orderings of the roles and cases
    respectively, and 
    establish links on the basis of priority determined by these orderings
  * Extensive illustrations of these various principles are given, 
    from Japanese and other languages
* the system is integrated with Bresnan's 'Realistic Transformational Grammar'
* The place of the Lexicon in the application of all these components
  * lexical rules provide a neat formulation for Verb Diathesis which interact
    with Case

# In the remaining four chapters, the system is applied to Classical Sanskrit

* A substanlially complete analysis of Sanskrit phrase-structure and case-incid
* All the traditional cases are given representations in the framework which
  are illustrated in extenso

# 4 alternations in transitivity
  from the standpoint of a theory of Sanskrit lexical entries

# 5 the Sanskrit Passive

* analysis of it as a Diathesis within the terms of the system
* it presents evidence against other current theories of the passive,
  those due to Relational Grammar and the Revised Extended Standard Theory
