# Abstract

* The word-frequency distribution of a text written by an author is well
  accounted for by a maximum entropy distribution, the RGF (random group
  formation)-prediction.
* The RGF-distribution is
  * completely determined by the a priori values of the
    * total number of words in the text (M), the
    * number of distinct words (N) and the
    * number of repetitions of the most common word (k max ).
* It is here shown that this maximum entropy prediction also describes a text
  written in Chinese characters. In particular
  * the same Chinese text written in words and Chinese characters have quite
    differently shaped distributions, they are nevertheless both well predicted
    by their respective three a priori characteristic values. It is pointed out
  * analogous to ... translating a given text to another language. Another
  * taking a part of a long text will change the input parameters
  * any specific language characteristic has to be sought in systematic
    deviations from the RGF-prediction and the measured frequencies.
    * Since the RGF-prediction has no [parameters] beyond the three a priori
    * One such systematic deviation is identified and,
      * through a statistical information theoretical argument and an extended
        RGF-model, it is proposed that this deviation is
      * caused by multiple meanings of Chinese characters.
      * The effect is stronger for Chinese characters than for Chinese words.
* The relation [to] Zipfâ€™s law [and] the Simon-model for texts [is]  discussed
