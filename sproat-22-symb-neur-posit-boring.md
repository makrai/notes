Boring Problems Are Sometimes the Most Interesting

# Abstract

* Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun: symbolic methods are not needed in AI and that,
  while there are still many issues to be resolved,
  AI will be solved using purely neural methods
* we demonstrate that a purely neural approach to the problem of
  text normalization is [not] possible
  * unrecoverable errors:
  * the system substitutes some other reading for the correct one
  * Solutions have been proposed that involve a
    marriage of traditional finite-state methods with neural models
    * hE not shown that the problem can be solved using neural methods alone
  * Various groups have tried, but nobody has eliminated the problem
  * hardly an “exciting” problem
  * nL until one can solve “boring” problems like that using purely AI methods,
    one cannot claim that AI is a success
