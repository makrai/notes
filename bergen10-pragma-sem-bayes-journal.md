Pragmatic reasoning through semantic inference
Semantics & Pragmatics Volume 9, Article 20, 2016


#Abstract 

* techniques from game theory and Bayesian cognitive science to formalize
  Gricean pragmatic reasoning 
  (Franke 2009, Frank & Goodman 2012, Goodman & Stuhlmüller 2013, Jäger 2012).
* two phenomena which pose a challenge to these accounts of pragmatics:
  * M-implicatures (Horn 1984) 
  * embedded implicatures which violate Hurford’s constraint (Hurford 1974,
    Chierchia+ 2012). While techniques have been developed for deriving
* we propose a realignment of the division between semantic and pragmatic cont
* a novel class of implicature, non-convex disjunctive implicatures
