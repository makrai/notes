* ways in which a distinction can be criticized, and
  more than one in which it can be rejected
  * for not being a sharp distinction
    (for admitting of cases which do not fall clearly on either side of it)
  * terms in which it is customarily drawn are ambiguous
    * confused (the different meanings being habitually conflated)
  * Such criticisms alone would scarcely amount to a rejection of the
    distinction.  They would, rather, be a prelude to clarification
    * It is not this sort of criticism which Quine makes
  * not useful
    * useless for certain purposes, or useless altogether, and ...  pedantic
  * the way or ways in which a distinction is customarily expounded or
    explained
    * explanations did not make it really clear
    * Quine certainly makes such criticisms
* presumption in favor of the distinction
  * distinction which they are supposed to express, and which at different
    times philosophers have supposed themselves to be expressing by means of
    such pairs of words or phrases as "necessary" and "contingent", "a priori"
    and "empirical", "truth of reason" and "truth of fact";
  * present practice
    * They apply the term "analytic" to more or less the same cases ... and
    * hesitate over more or less the same cases
    * agreement extends ... to new cases
* Quine's thesis might be better represented [as] that the nature of, and
  reasons for, the difference or differences are totally misunderstood by those
  who use the expressions, that the stories they tell themselves about the
  difference are full of illusion
* _the_ difference these philosophers supposed themselves to be marking by the
  use of the expressions simply did not exist,
  * philosophers are prone to make too few distinctions rather than too many
  * It is their assimilations, rather than their distinctions, which tend to be
    spurious
* translation
* Instead of examining the actual use that we make of the notion of _meaning
  the same_, the philosopher measures it by [some standard of clarifiability],
  and because it falls short of this standard, or seems to do so, denies its
  reality, declares it illusory
* Quine: circle or family of expressions
  * if any one member of the circle could be taken to be satisfactorily
    understood or explained, then other members of the circle could be
    verbally, and hence satisfactorily, explained in terms of it
  * Other members of the family are:
    * "self-contradictory" (in a broad sense),
    * "necessary",
    * "synonymous",
    * "semantical rule", and perhaps
    * in a broad sense, "definition"
* group of expressions which includes
  * "morally wrong", "blameworthy", "breach of moral rules", etc
  * propositional connectives and the words "true" and "false,' "statement",
    "fact,' "denial,' 'assertion"
  * they have not been formally defined
    except in terms of members of the same group
* "analytic" and "synthetic" are technical philosophical expressions
  * terms belonging to the circle are either technical terms or ordinary terms
    used in specially adjusted senses,
(i) "My neighbor's three-year-old child understands
    Russell's Theory of Types,"
(I') "My neighbor's three-year-old child is an adult."
* logical impossibility of a child of three's being an adult, and the natural
  impossibility of a child of three's understanding Russell's Theory of Types
  * in both cases we would tend to begin by supposing that the other speaker
    was using words in a figurative or unusual or restricted way; but in the
    face of his repeated claim to be speaking literally, it would be
    appropriate
  * in the first case to say that we did not believe him and
  * in the second case to say that we did not understand him
  * incredulity yielding to conviction vs
    incomprehension yielding to comprehension
* sections 5 and 6, in which diagnosis and positive theory are offered p13
