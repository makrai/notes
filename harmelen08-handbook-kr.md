# Preface

Fifty years later ...  Advances have been made on three fronts
  1. general methods of knowledge representation and reasoning, addressing
    fundamental issues that cut across application domains
  2. specialized methods of knowledge representation and reasoning to handle
    core domains, such as _time, space, causation and action_
  3. applications of knowledge representation and reasoning
    * question answering, the Semantic Web, planning, robotics and multi-agent
      systems.
  * the book is divided into three sections to cover these themes.
* Organization
  * Part I 
    * background on classical logic and theorem proving
    * extend classical logic [to] qualitative or uncertain information
    * improve its computational tractability.
    * chapters
      1. classical logic and methods of automated reasoning.
      2. the remarkable success of satisfiability (SAT) solvers
      3. Description Logics, terminological knowledge, Semantic Web
      4. constraint programming
      5. reviews the influential work on Conceptual Graphs. This
        structured representation provides an expressive language and powerful
        reasoning methods that are essential for applications such as Natural
        Language Understanding.
      6. introduces nonmonotonic logics, which deal with complications
        related to handling exceptions to general rules.
      7. builds on the previous one
      8. continues this theme
      9. 
        * qualitative models of continuous systems
        * reasoning with incomplete information
        * important for numerous tasks, such as diagnosis and tutoring.
      10. explicit model of the behavior of systems for tasks such as
        design, testing, and diagnosis.
      11. uncertainty, Bayesian networks
 * Part II
  * ch12 time should be modeled with points or intervals, and at what level of
    granularity
  13. space—including topology, orientation, shape, size and distance
  14. physical reasoning (for liquids and solid objects)
  15. an agent’s knowledge and beliefs, including propositions about the
      knowledge state of other agents
  16. “situation calculus”, dynamic worlds. As first defined by McCarthy and
      Hayes, first-order objects that can be quantified over,
  17. Event Calculus as an alternative ... representing continuous events,
      nondeterministic effects, events with duration, triggered events
  18. continues the development of representation languages designed for
      dynamic worlds by introducing Temporal Action Logics.
  19. Nonmonotonic Causal Logic
  * Part III
  20. QA: select relevant passages of text (an information retrieval task),
      interpret them (a natural language understanding task) and infer an
      answer to the question (a reasoning task).
  25. knowledge engineering: how to acquire the knowledge that can be expressed
      in the formalisms described in the other chapters.
