* vector space models in cognitive science.
  * Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky (1986);
    Smith, Osherson, Rips, & Keane, (1988), utilise notions of
    distance between concepts represented as feature vectors. More recently
  * Gärdenfors (2004) has developed a model of concepts in which
    * conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and
    * information is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector space
