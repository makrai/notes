# 1 Introduction

* srl (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Christensen+ 2011)
* lack of consensus on the various _categories_ and the criteria for determining
  which today are already available for many languages, causing difficulties in
  čezjezikovnem model semantic labeling should in our view, an effective system
* criteria and indications for marking participatory roles or, more precisely
  predikatno- argumentnih relationships
  * to provide a set of categories, which is the most optimal, ie. cover all
    (in our case Slovene) key participatory roles and at the same time
  * does not contain categories that are excessively detailed or mutual
    overlays,
  * be based primarily on semantic rather than on morphological, lexical or
    syntactic properties,
  * allow for formal description or usefulness of language technology
    applications, and
  * to be as compatible with the categories and criteria applicable to other
    languages (cf.. Petukhov and Bunt, 2008: 39)

# 2 Theoretical and methodological background

* We first analyzed the individual approaches that have been developed and used
  for other languages,
  * for example.
    * for English
      * PropBank (Palmer+ 2005)
      * Verbnet (Kipper+ 2006) and
      * FrameNet (Backer+ 1998),
    * Ancor (Taul+ 2011) for the Spanish,
    * Sonar (Schuurman+ 2010) for the Dutch. In addition, a
    * set of codes for Croatian (Filko+ 2012) and the
    * Czech valence lexicon Vallex. We focused on
  * comparing formal descriptions (ie. Sets of semantic tags) for each
    participatory role and the criteria for their determination
  * range of participatory roles and their formal descriptions are derived from
    the functional generative approach of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT,
    Mikulov+ 2006)
  * our tag set is a simplification of PDT with ideas from FrameNet

# 3 Set of labels and the criteria for their determination

* for example. for different time categories (When, parallel, from a when, this
  is a when, how long, since a when, etc. - a total of 9) who have in PDT
  separate codes in the Slovenian range combined into just three: TIME (time),
  DUR (duration ) and the FREQ (frequency). At the same time, we determined
  that tag TIME includes semantic links that correspond to the definitions as
  when, by coincidence, to / from time to time, the code DUR provides links
  that define the duration of the condition or action (how long), FREQ but
  frequency (how often, how many times).

# 5 Conclusion and future work

* In the next phase we intend in the context of a bilateral project between
  Slovenia and Croatia to establish a system for SRL that will be assigned to
  existing syntactic dependency links in training corps
