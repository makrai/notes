Sem interpretation in gen gramm

csak a 2. fejezetet szeretném elolvasni, azt is csak them hier kapcsán

# Preface p5

generative semantics: synt and sem are inseparable
I: the two can be accounted for independently

# 1 Outline of the theo p7

interaction between sem and synt rules

## 1.1

* Chomsky:1957: no meaning
* Katz and Fodor (1963)
  * language-indep
  * by making sem part of gen gramm, more incisive [metsző, éles] study of
    meaning would be possible

## 1.2 ...sem component p8

* Katz and Fodor
  * taken for granted is a single hier struct into which the sem content of the
    lex items in the sent is arranged
* we: 
  * different anal for different groups of phenomena
  * four parts of sem repr
    1. func struct induced by the verb (agent, motion, direction). Hier
    2. modal struct, hier ch7 
      * scope of negation and quantifiers
      * reference in sem representations 
        * indef NPs
        * genericity
        * ref opacity
      * illocutory force of a sent 
        * declarative, imperative, interrogative
        * in func struct (Ross 1970a, Lakoff 1968)
    3. table of coref for pairs of NPs
    4. focus and presupp
      * topic-comment, thematic struct
* Katz and Postal (1964), KP2
  * the only synt info used in determin sem interpret is the underlying (deep)
    struct
  * <- motivation, objection, consequences in sec 1.3
  * func struct 
    * the sole source of sem info
    * preserved by trafo
  * diagram 1.1
* this study
  * various parts of sem repr relate to various levels of synt deriv
  * diagram 1.2
* parallel processing

## 1.3 Katz--Postal p9

* sem interp is performed by projection rules
  * adds those parts not due to lex items but synt
  * for each phrase struct rule and trafo rule, an assoced proj rule, 
    * type P1 and P2 resp
    * P1 e.g. 
      * attribution, modifier--head
      * S V O
    * P2 
      * become innecessary since Katz and Fodor, KP1
      * Katz and Postal: no change of meaning are induced by trafos
      * insertion rules insert meaningless particles like _do_ or inflectional
        markers 
* much of the book is devoted to arease where KP1 cannot be justified
  * error in Katz and Postal: discuss of negation (scope)
* we interpret derived structs rather than derivations
* KP2 => deep struct must represent logical struct rather than synt struct if
  the two conflict
  * abstract deep structs (Lakoff, Ross, McCawley)
  * we will show, sem account adds less total machinery
  * deep struct grows closer and closer to sem repr -> dispensing with deep
    struct, generating sem reprs and proceed by trafos (McCawley, Lakoff,
    Postal)
  * extremely unconstrained notion of trafo

## 1.4 On choosing between two theories p12

* three kinds of differences corresponding to Chomsky:1965's levels of
  observational, descriptive, and explanatory adequacy
  2. generalizations about lang
    * in 1,2 the rules Pronominalization, Reflexivization, and Complement
      Subject Interpretation can be ordered together --> sim in their environs
  3. classes of possible grammars defined by the theos
* integrity of lex items (last paragraph of printed page 12)
  * Chomsky 1970a Lexical Hypothesis: trafo does not deriv morph
* other constraint on trafos by Emonds (1970)

## 1.5 Elems of sem interpretation p14

* Katz and Fodor are interested in synonymy, analyticity, anomaly, truth
  conditions, and actual content
* we: content, and how it is derived
* disclaimers
  * infinite divisibility of sem properties
  * what info is part of the reading and what merely follows from the reading
    (Wittgenstein 1958, Quine 1960)
  * we will be more concerned with how the meaning of lex items are _combined_
* sem subfuncs of verbs e.g. causative, directional, etc.
  * the sem repr of a verb has some internal func struct
  * nautral sem (and synt) classes of verbs
  * Katz 1966, Gruber 1965, 1967a, b
  * higher pro-verbs (Lakoff 1971, McCawley 1968b), case gramm (Fillmore 1968)
    represent this internal struct in synt

## 1.6 Well formedness p15

* some are part of the gramm, others that of pragmatics and konwledge of the
  real world
1. selectional restrictions

> It's crazy to talk of rocks eating.

2. Consistency Condition on coreferents
3. Thematic Hier Cond, chaps 2 and 4
* constraints on the selection of corefs of complement subjects

## 1.7 Assumptions about the synt amd the lex p17

* differences from Aspects
  * lexical insertion will be simpler, unrestricted
  * synt nodes as distinctive feature matrices
* transformational cycle
* internal struct of the lexicon, 
  * Extended Lex Hyp
    * derivations do not perform deriv morph e.g. nominalization
  * since than: Lakoff (1971), Chapin (1967) vs Gruber (1967b)
  * we: separate lex items related by morph or sem redundancy rules

## 1.8 Remarks on motivating rules p18

# 2 Gramm rels and the func struct p19

## 2.1 Sem insuff of func rels 

## 2.2 Thematic rels p21

* based on Gruber
* which is the theme
  * verbs of motion
  * verbs of location
  * extension to abstract
* Location, Source, Goal
  * adjectives, "quality space"
* Agent: will or volition
  * causative
  * _in order to_, _so that_, _intentionally_
  * imperative
* in what sense are thematic relations more than a  way of describing certain
  facts about semantic interpretations and the distribution of prepositions
  * unifying various uses of the same morphological verb
  * distribution of reflexives, passive, antecedents for deleted comp subj

## 2.3 Thematic relations vs Case Grammar 24

* 1 NP : 1 Case
* _buy_ and _sell_, _trade sg to sy for x_

## 2.4 Correlating thematic rels with deep struct p25

## 2.5 The thematic hierarchy condition p28

# 3 Adverbs p30

## 3.3 p32

### 3.5.2. p38

## 3.11 p50

# 4 Pronouns and reflexives

# 5 Coref and complem

## 5.4 p100

# 6 Focus and presupp

# 7 Modal struct

# 8 Negation

# 9 Conclusion and hypotheses
