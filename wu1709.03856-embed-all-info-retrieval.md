Ruder: a general-purpose model that is
compatible with [applications like] information retrieval, recommendation, and
link prediction in knowledge bases, and
can serve as a strong baseline

#Abstract

* We present StarSpace, a general-purpose neural embedding model that
* can solve a wide variety of problems:
  * labeling tasks such as text classification,
  * ranking tasks such as information retrieval/web search, collaborative
    filtering-based or content-based recommendation,
  * embedding of multi-relational graphs, and
  * learning word, sentence or document level embeddings. In each case the
* model works by embedding those entities comprised of discrete features and [
  learning their] similarities dependent on the task
* Empirical results on a number of tasks show that
  StarSpace is highly competitive with existing methods, whilst also being
  generally applicable to new cases where those methods are not
