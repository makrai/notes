Deeper Look into Dependency-Based Word Embeddings
NAACL-SRW 2018

#Abstract

We investigate the effect
  * of various dependency-based word embeddings
    * Stanford and Universal dependencies at several levels of enhancement
      (ranging from unlabeled, to Enhanced++ dependencies)
  * on distinguishing between functional and domain similarity,
    word similarity rankings, and two downstream tasks in English
* Results are
  * compared to basic linear contexts datasets. We found that embeddings
  * Universal and Stanford dependency contexts excel at different tasks, and
  * enhanced dependencies often improve performance
