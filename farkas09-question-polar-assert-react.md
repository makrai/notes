# Abstract

* capture the similarities and differences between assertions vs polar questons
  * systematic partial overlap in reactions to these speech acts
* organization
  * the discourse components we assume
  * default assertions and default polar questions in a way that allows us to
    characterize two types of responses to these speech acts,
    confirming and reversing reactions
    * The common characteristics of assertions and polar questions are
      responsible for the fact that both allow these reactions;
    * the differences between the two speech acts explain
      the different contextual effects confirming and reversing moves have
      depending on whether they react to an assertion or a polar question
  * distribution of a set of ‘polarity’ particles in Romanian
    in terms of the notions defined
  * a series of predictions concerning polarity particles across languages

# 1 Introduction 1

* organization
  2. the context structure we use
  3. a characterization of assertions and polar questions
  4. a special type of reactions to assertions and polar questions
    that exhibits the partial overlap we are interested in capturing
  5. the distribution of a set of particles occuring in a subtype of such reacts
* discourse structure is Stalnaker (1978)
  * common ground (cd)
    * an ever changing background made up of a set of
      propositions already confirmed by the discourse participants
      * whose intersection is the context set (cs)
* The essential effect of assertions on the context in which they are made,
  * assertions add the content of the assertion to the cg,
    ‘provided that there are no objections from the other participants
  * Assertion is a proposal to change the context by adding the content
    * Clark (1992); Clark & Schaefer (1989) and Ginzburg (1996, forthcoming),
      emphasizing the proposal nature of assertion
    * rather than actually changing it, is necessary in order to
      make room for the large variety of reactions to assertions
      * confirmation, rejection or the need for further discussion
* public individual commitments in discourse
  * Hamblin (1971) and Gunlogson (2001) have stressed their role
  * the main effect of uttering a declarative sentence with falling intonation
    is to add its propositional content to the speaker’s list of public commitms
  * This view neglecting that such speech acts also
    turn the content of the declarative sentence into a shared commitment
* The context components we adopt here allow us to capture
  both the __commitment publicizing__ and the __proposal__ nature of def asserts
* default polar questions on the other hand do not register author commitment
  * They propose to add to the cg
    either the denotation of their sentence radical or its complement
* focus of our work: capturing the similarities and differences between
  reactions to assertions vs to polar questions
  * overlap between the two types of reactions is illustrated in (2):
(2/3) Anne: Sam is home/Is Sam home?
    Ben: Yes/Yeah, he’s home./No, he isn’t home
* Ben’s negative reaction to assertions/questions creates/not a conversat crisis
  * Anne’s contributions in (2) and (3) raise the issue of Sam’s whereabouts;
  * in (2), but not (3), she also adds the prop _S's h_ to her public commitmnts
* At the root of the ‘conversational crisis’ are the following two assumptions:
  * conversational changes that result in additions to commitments are less
    marked than those that result in the reTRaction of such commitments, and
  * raising an issue steers the conversation
    toward a state where the issue is resolved
* In (2) after Ben’s negative reaction can be settled only after either Ben or
  Anne retracts a commitment
* formal properties <= The difference between the contextual effect of
  contradicting an assertion and giving the ‘opposite’ answer to a polar questi
  * eg Romanian, where the particle _ba_ is possible when contradicting a
    positive assertion but not in a negative answer to a positive question
* significant parallelisms and div between reactions to assert vs to polar qs
  * Our main goal in this paper is to capture this partial overlap
  * we also have to differentiate between
    * initiating assertions (eg Anne’s contributions above) and
    * ‘reactive’ assertions (eg Ben’s contributions)
    -> account for the distribution of particles such as yes and no

# 2 Context components 3

* we present a model of context structure that
  combines features of earlier proposals
  (Ginzburg (1996), Ginzburg (), Gunlogson (2001) & Asher & Lascarides (2003))
  within the tradition of Stalnaker (1978), Hamblin (1971), and Carlson (1983)
  * to capture the similarities and differences between assertions and polar qs
* An essential component of models of context, acknowledged since the earliest:
  * representation of the discourse commitments of participants
  * discourse commitments are propositions (i.e., sets of worlds)
    publicly taken by the participants as being true of the world of the conver,
    from the perspective of the conversation (Sacks 1992)
* how to relate discourse commitments to participants
  * Stalnaker (1978) assumes a single set of shared public commitments, the cg
  * Hamblin (1971) and Gunlogson (2001):
    each participant is associated with a set of discourse commitments
    * Gunlogson (2001) defines the common ground as an ancillary notion
      * the union of the participants’ commitment sets
  * Stalnaker’s cg can be defined as the intersection of these sets
  * Ginzburg: there is
    * a common ground, called FACTS
    * a dialogue game board containing both public and private aspects
      associated with each participant in the conversation
    * Our canonical Table-emptying operations correspond to Ginzburg’s
      operations that downgrade QUD and upgrade the FACTS
      once a resolution of the issue on the Table has been agreed upon
  * Asher & Lascarides (2003): each participant is associated with a
    * Segmented Discourse Representation Structure (SDRS) that
      * represents their cognitive state
    * The common ground is reconstructed via a relation, called _settled_,
      defined between a content and a discourse structure
    * _settled_ includes
      questions that participants are committed to supplying an answer to 
      requests they are publicly committed to carrying out
* We present here a model that separates a Stalnakerian cg
  from the discourse commitment set of each participant
  * The discourse commitment set of a participant A at a time t in a conversat c
    contains those propositions
    * A has publicly committed to in the course of c up to t and which have
    * not (yet) become mutual commitments
  * The cg on the other hand, is that set of propositions that
    * have been agreed upon by all participants in c at t and those that
    * represent the shared background knowledge of the discourse participants
* Having the cg as a separate component allows us to capture
  * proposing to add the propositionl content of the asserted sentence to the cg
  * what Stalnaker takes the crucial effect of assertions to be
  * allows us to explain
    * that assertion acceptance is a default move rather than contradictg/denial
    * the existence of conversational pressure in the direction of
      increasing the cg by turning publicized commitments into joint commitments
      * Without such pressure the Collaborative Principle of Walker (1996) would
        remain mysterious
      * requires participants to provide evidence of detected ‘discrepancy in
        belief’ as soon as possible in a conversation
      * Were it not for the drive to build a cg,
        discrepancy in publicized belief would not be problematic, and thus
        no special need of being signaled
* Commitment sets (whether the cg or individual commitment sets)
  can be upgraded or downgraded
  * upgrading is more canonical than downgrading
  * Walker (1996): of a default rule, makes beliefs persistent
  * In our terms: addition is a canonical change to a commitment set
    while retraction is not
* More concretely, we assume that a discourse structure K contains
  * a (possibly empty) set of propositions `DC_X` for each participant X
    * those propositions that X has publicly committed to up to the relevant t
    * not shared by all the other participants
  * a set of propositions, the cg, whose elements are
    those propositions that have been confirmed by all participants
    as well as a set of background propositions
* The total discourse commitments of a discourse participant X is `DC_X ∪ cg`
  * taken to be a subset of her doxastic base (cf. Grice’s Quality Maxim)
  * not required to be correct, and therefore they need not be in fact true
  * a participant is coherent iff her total discourse commitments are consistent
    * a discourse whose cg is inconsistent is in crisis
* Separating participants’ discourse commitments from the cg is
  essential in accounting for disagreements in ordinary discourses
  * One way a discourse may survive denial is when participants
    __agree to disagree__. Leaving the details for Section 4
  * The state of the discourse in this case should record
    A’s commitment to p and B’s commitment to ¬p but
    neither p nor ¬p should be in the cg
  * In our model, p \in `DC_A`, ¬p \in `DC_B` and p, ¬p !\in cg
  * consistent cg and coherent particips even though `DC_A ∪ DC_B` is not consi
  * the level that counts for purposes of presupposition satisfaction 
    is the cg rather than either of the participant’s commitment set
    * eg, after having agreed to disagree on whether Sam is home, it would be
      infelicitous for A to say _Since Sam is home, the children are not alone_
      even if A has previously committed to Sam being home
* Ginzburg (1996), Roberts (1996), and Büring (2003): there is
  a discourse component that records the questions under discussion
  * We re-christen it the Table and assume that
    the items on it are syntactic objects paired with their denotations
  * syntactic objects on the Table is needed because a grammar of
    cross-turn conversation and ellipsis has to have access to the form of
    immediately previous utterances
    * eg, in many languages polar questions can be answered by
      repeating the main V of the question with the same or the reverse pola
    * ‘fragment answers’ (independently of the finer details of their treatment)
    => asserting a sentence such as Sam is home makes a
      different contribution to the Table from asking the question Is Sam home?
* the Table is a stack of 'issues’ in the conversation
  * When the Table is not empty, the immediate goal of the conversation is to
    empty it, i.e.  to settle the issue at hand
  * allows us to capture the tight connection between
    * initiating conversational moves, such as an initiating assertion or questi
    * responding moves that address the issue
      an immediately preceding utterance has placed on the Table
* having the Table as a separate component allows us to differentiate between
  context states that can/not serve as natural endpoints of a discourse
  * As long as there are items on the Table, there are issues
* two fundamental engines that drive conversations are the need to
  * increase the cg: drives participants to place items on the Table;
  * reach a stable state: drives them to take steps to remove these
    * in such a way as to increase the cg
  * novelty: we attempt to capture these twin goals by assuming that
    every conversational move that places an item on the Table is associated
    with a canonical way of removing that item from the Table
* The canonical way of removing an issue from the Table is to reach a discourse
  state in which the issue is decided
  * A proposition p is decided relative to a common ground cg if and only if
    p follows from the cg or if ¬p follows from the cg
* projectied set
  * a conversational move that places an item on the Table
    simultaneously projects a set of future common grounds
    relative to which the issue on the Table is decided
  * These projected sets are supersets of the current cg
  * the projected set (ps) is a separate component
  * an assertion projects confirmation in that
    it projects a future common ground that includes the asserted proposition
  * A question projects resolution in the sense that
    it projects a set of future common grounds
    arrived at by adding to each common ground in the input ps
    each (contextually) possible answer to the question
  * Assertions and questions
    * are similar in that their effect on the ps is to add their denotations to
      the elements of the input ps
    * differ in that for assertions/q, only one/set of proposition/s is added &
      therefore only one/set of resolution/s is projected
  * When the Table is empty, the ps contains the current cg as its only element
  * otherwie, the elements of the ps are computed based on what is on the Table
* The ps assumes a central role in our view because it is
  * the anticipatory nature of certain conversational moves is captured here
  * moves may steer conversations towards particular privileged futures
    * not directly represented in the conversational state
  * in Asher and Lascarides’s work, only this:
    * future moves must find a possible rhetorical relation that
      attaches them to the conversation
  * An assertion/questions may be
    * contradicted, confirmed, called into question, elaborated on, or corrected
    * confirmation resp resolution is special
      * this is what is projected at the ps level
* moves that place items on the Table define a set of conversational goal states
  reached when the item in question is removed from the Table in a way that
  maximally increases the cg
  * ps in characterizing
    * what A’s proposal is when she makes her assertion, as well as
    * what the questioner directs the conversation toward when he asks his quest
* ps allows us to import the insights of earlier work on the
  context change of assertions and questions
  * we perform these changes at the level of the ps
    * instead of performing at the level of the cg
      (or its intersection, the context set)
* a conversation is in crisis if its cg is inconsistent or if
  all the sets in its ps are inconsistent
  * Having at least one consistent set in the ps means that
    there are __canonical__ moves that lead to emptying the Table
    while at the same time reaching a consistent cg
* For the matters we discuss here, no need for further additions to context stru
  * such as the agendas of participants or
    representations of their private doxastic states
  * our model is consistent with
    expansion in these directions, as well as with
    additions of finer grained structures for dealing with anaphoric relations
* the information we do represent is redundant for the examples we discuss
  * the contents of the ps can always be calculated
    from the current cg and the items on the Table
  * nL include it in our representation for the sake of clarity and
    for emphasizing similarities between what we propose and previous approaches
* diagrams of the form below:
* `DC_A` and `DC_B` are the propositions A and B have individually publicly
  committed to and which are not joint commitments
  * cg is the set of propositions that are joint commitments of the participants
  * The contents of the Table, S, are items that are still under discussion,
  * ps is a set of common grounds that reflects canonical ways of settling the
    issues on the Table
* notation we use throughout the rest of the paper. The table T in a context
  * to represent traditional stack operations on T :
  1. push(e, T) represents the new stack obtained by adding item e to the top
  2. pop(T) represents the stack obtained by popping off the top item of T 
  3. top(T) represents the top item of the stack T 
  4. remove(e, T) represents the stack obtained by removing the top-most
     occurrence of e from stack T.  If e does not occur in T, then T is returned
* Lastly, let
  ps = {cg 1,..., cg n} be a collection of sets of propositions (e.g.,
  possible common grounds) and let
  P = {p 1,..., p m} be a set of propositions
  Then define ps ∪ P = {cg i ∪ {p j} | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} − {cg' | cg' is
  inconsistent}
  * each new set is formed by adding one of the elements of P to an existing
    `cg_i`. At the end, any new sets that are inconsistent are discarded
  * assume an operator that rebuilds the projected set ps from the current cg
    and the contents of the Table T
    by iteratively performing the ps changes associated with each item on the
    Table
    * needed after a non-canonical conversational move is made, such as
      retracting an assertion, agreeing to disagree, or withdrawing a question

# 3 Default Assertions and Default Polar Questions 7

* in order to capture the details of their similarities and differences
* explain why there is overlap in the range of reactions to them and
  why this overlap is only partial

## 3.1 Default Assertions

* include assertions in the repertory of speech acts
  * many subtypes of assertions, and their complex typology
  * default assertion is performed when a participant X utters
    a declarative sentence S with falling intonation that not place specific
    demands on the input context
  * not addressed here, are
    ‘rising declaratives’ as well as assertions followed by interrogative tags
* declarative and interrogative sentences are distinguished by
  the sentential features [D] and [I] respectively
  * sentential markers because it is crucial to what follows for [the sentence
    radical to which they attach to be accessible in subsequent discourse]
  * Hamblin (1971): the denotation of a declarative sentence S[D] is the
    singleton set containing the proposition denoted by its sentence radical
* Krifka (2001) (see also Ginzburg (forthcoming)) in assuming that
  there are __speech act operators__ that take sentences as arguments
  * functions from input context states to output context states
  * the default assertion operator A is a function from an input context `K_i`
    to an output context `K_o`, as in (9), where `a` is the author of the assert
  * `DC_a,o` and `DC_a,i` are a’s output and input context discourse commitments,
  * `T_o`, `T_i` are the output and input Table, respectively:
(9) `A(S[D], a, K_i) = K_o` such that
  * `DC_a,o = DC_a,i ∪ {p}`  (common to all types of assertions, default or not)
  * `T_o = push(<S[D]; {p}>, T_i)`
  * `ps_o = ps_i ∪ {p}`
* A default assertion then
  * commits its author to the propositional content of the asserted sentence,
  * raises an issue by placing an item on the Table, and
  * directs the conversation towards a unique resolution of that issue, namely
    confirmation of the assertion
* The ‘issue’ is the denotation of the sentence radical added to the Table in
  the course of the assertion
* yields an output context that is biased in favor of confirmation
* The changes A brings about echo those in Poesio & Traum (1998), where an
  assertion is defined as committing the speaker to the belief in its
  propositional content, while simultaneously
  attempting to get the addressee to believe that content as well
  * The main difference is that we are considering here changes triggered by
    particular linguistic forms that target particular conversational components
    * independent of participants’ actual beliefs and intentions
  * the participant may in fact aim at provoking her interlocutor to contradict,
    misleading an eavesdropper or have other complex agendas
  * we are interersted in those conversational effects that are
    * constant across all these situations
    * connected to sentence form, prosodical properties, & the input conv state
  * We thus define speech acts in terms of
    * their Heimean context change potential (CCP) 
    * not the actual intentions of speakers
* We follow here Stalnaker’s suggestion that
  a side-effect of any speech act is to register in the common ground the fact
  that the speech act in question has occurred
* For Stalnaker, the essential context change associated with assertions is the
  addition of p to the common ground
  * The parallel change for us is the addition of p to the elements of the ps
    * Not changing the current common ground directly
      leaves room for moves that react to assertions
* earlier proposals that our view (assertions put issue on the Table) follows
  * closest to Ginzburg’s
  * For us, just as for Ginzburg, asserting a sent raises the issue of whether p
  * In our approach hE it diffs how the issue is raised by an assert/polar quest
  * similarly: addition of the asserted proposition to the author’s discourse
    commitment list is the essential feature of declarative updates
* separating confirmatn vs all other possible moves that follow a default assert
  * a feature we exploit below in capturing differences between reactions to
    assertions and reactions to polar questions
* default assertions may
  initiate a discourse but they may also
  connect to previous discourse by a variety of rhetorical relations
  * eg Elaboration or Counterevidence, focus of Asher & Lascarides (2003),
  * the veridicality of assertions, follows from the 1. and 3. change in (9)
    * veridicality is crucial in Asher & Reese (2007)
* assertions, as well as questions and other speech acts, are
  associated not only with literal content but with implicated content as well
  * implicated content is added on the Table
    conjoined with but separated from the literal content
    making it possible for further moves to react to both implicated and literal
  * One difference between the two types of content is that
    only literal content is associated with syntactic material on the Table
    => we predict differences between them in discourse ellipsis

## 3.2 Default Polar Questions 10

* how the context changes when a polar question speech act is performed
  * Syntactically, we represent polar interrogatives as S[I]
  * The denotation of S[I] is {p, ¬p}
    * footnoe: Following Karttunen (1977) we assume that the
      denot of an interrogative sentence is the set of its complete answers
* raises the issue `whether p` by placing on the conversational Table the
  interrogative sentence and its denotation, namely {p, ¬p}
  * steers the conversation towards a state in which the question is resolved
  * add to each of ps's elements each of the elements in the denotation
* the effect of assertions and questions on the Table and on the ps
  * in both cases a sentence and its denotation are added to the Table and
    each element of the denotation of the sentence
    is added to each element of the input ps
  * The differences follow from the fact that the denotation of the declarative
    sentence is a singleton set while that of an interrogative is not
* we not keep track of who placed a particular item on the Table
  because nothing we discuss here is sensitive to this aspect
* We define the polar question operator PQ as in (12), where
  S[I] is a polar interrogative sentence, and p is the denotation of S:
(12) Polar question operator (PQ)
  `PQ(S[I], K_i) = K_o` such that
  * `T_o = push(<S[I]; {p, ¬p}>, T_i)`
  * `ps_o = ps_i ∪{p, ¬p}`
* The context state after a default polar question is inquisitive [kíváncsi]
  with respect to
  the denotation of the sentence radical the move has placed on the Table
  because the ps contains both future common grounds to which p/\neg p was added
* The most immediate way in which such a context is returned to a stable state
  * the addressee providing a complete direct answer to the question
  * a confirmation of this answer by the participants in the conversation
  * leads to the addition of the answer to the cg
  * getting the question removed from the Table
* Default polar questions are non-biasing in the sense that
  they do not commit their author to either proposition in their denotation
  * project an inquisitive context with respect to their sentence radical
  * There are hE non-default polar questions that are not impartial
    * In English, polar interrogatives involving external negation, as
      (13) Isn’t Sam home?
    * have been treated as involving some sort of pre-existing bias
    * footnote: questions that introduce strong bias are non-default
      * We come back to weak bias in positive and in inner negation polar quests
        in Section 4.2
    * in favor of the proposition in the scope of the negative operator
    * issue is much debated (van Rooy & Safarova (2003), Romero & Han (2004))
* the two speech acts we are concerned with in this paper contrast in
  both whether they affect author commitment and in how they affect the ps
  * Default assertions/polar questions add/not to author commitment and
    project a non/inquisitive ps
  * Non-default assertions and non-default polar questions can depart from their
    default counterparts in either property
* non-default questions
  1. The most often discussed are those involving some bias
  2. indicates that
    settling the issue is not necessarily a projected conversational future, and
    therefore that answering the question is optional
    * In Romanian, such questions are signaled by the particle _oare_
    * the output ps includes
      not only projected common grounds in which the question is decided but
      also a copy of the elements of the input ps thereby indicating that
      not answering the question is one of the projected discourse futures
    * not appropriate on forms, as exam questions, or as questions in court
* positive vs negative polar questions
  * a welcome consequence of our approach to polar questions
  * differentiate between positive and negative polar questions
    while at the same time assigning them the same denotation
  * An (inner negation) negative polar question such as: _Is Sam not home?_
  * the same effect on the ps
  * diff: neg places a negative rather than a positive sentence on the Table
  * Pragmatic differences as well as differences in the way they can be answered
    are connected to the difference in the contribution to the Table
  * without having to give up the uniform account of their denotation
* To sum up, the major
  * differences between default assertions vs (polar) questions
    * default assertions upgrade their author’s commitment list while
      default (polar) questions do not;
    * default assertions enter a declarative sentence on the Table, while
      polar questions enter an interrogative sentence;
    * at the level of the ps, default
      assertions result in a non-inquisitive context whereas default
      questions result in an inquisitive one
  * similarity between
    asserting a sentence S[D] and
    asking the corresponding polar question by uttering S[I] is
    that the same sentence radical, S, is placed on the Table
  * difference between S[D] and S[I] is that
    the denotation of D is a singleton and that of I is not
  * In both cases
    the sentence radical is decided relative to each element of the output ps
  * Reactions to these two speech acts, we predict, will be sensitive to this

# 4 Reacting to default assertions and default polar questions 12

## 4.1 Confirming and reversing an assertion 12

* After all participants in a conversation confirm an assertion, p, the
  proposition denoted by the asserted sentence radical, is present on the
  commitment list of each participant
* auxiliary move M 0
  * adds the proposition that is present on each commitment list to the cg and
  * removes it from individual commitment lists
* Assertion confirmation can be signaled in a variety of linguistic and
  non-linguistic ways. One can nod, say uh huh, sure, right, you bet, yup, etc
  * also by reasserting the asserted proposition, as in (18),
    using a more or less truncated form
    * we discuss responding assertion in detail in the next section
  * some other ways of indicating assertion confirmation involve implicature
    (For discussion, see Walker (1996))
  * may be left unsignaled altogether
    * unsurprising given the default nature of the move, under the natural
    * Silence can be seen as implicating confirmation
      based on Walker’s Collaborative Principle
    * In what follows we only deal with overt assertion confirmation moves
* Another way of deciding the issue for the author of the reactive move is to
  reverse the asserted proposition in toto or partially
  * total or partial denial
  (20)  Anne: Mary ordered chicken yesterday
        Ben: No, she didn’t./No, it was beef
  * highly marked and therefore they must be explicit and must be signaled,
    * Walker (1996) argues, as early as possible
    * marked because the proposition the author of a denial commits to cannot
      become a joint commitment in a coherent discourse without retraction
      => therefore the issue placed on the Table by the initial assertion
      cannot be removed in a canonical way
  * We restrict our attention here to denials expressed by an assertion
  * We narrow our focus further to total denials
    * The starkest form of total denial is to assert the opposite
    * may be performed by
      * assertions, as was the case in our example, or by
      * reversing markers such as no way, definitely not, etc
      * Denying responding assertions, exemplified by Ben’s assertion above will
        be examined in detail in the next subsection
  * one can eventually reach a stable state in one of two ways: 
    * one of the participants retracts their assertion; or 
    * the participants ‘agree to disagree’
    * We deal here only with the latter because
      * it underscores the need to separate participant commitments from the cg,
      * the complexities raised by retractions go beyond the scope of this paper
  * ‘agreeing to disagree’ involves
    removing <S[D]; {p}> and <S 0 [D]; {¬p}> from the Table
    without removing either p or ¬p from the relevant commitment lists
    * neither p nor ¬p is added to the cg
    * The common ground in K 5 is identical to the common ground in K 4 , K 3 ,
      and even K 1 , the context state that served as input to the D move
      * Under the assumption that that common ground, s 4 , was consistent and
        that it was consistent with both p and ¬p, the context state K 5 is
        consistent at every level and therefore the conversation is no longer in
        crisis
    * usually proposed by one of the participants by uttering an imperative such
      as Let’s agree to disagree/Let’s not pursue this further
      * after the other participant(s) agree to comply with the imperative
      * The imperative in this case is special in that compliance with it
        involves a change in the context state of the conversation

## 4.2 Confirming and reversing a polar question 15

* polar question confirmation
  * the move that reacts to a polar question by committing the author to the
    propositional content of the sentence radical S on the Table
  * similar to assertion confirmation in that
    the author of such a move commits to the propositional content of the
    sentence radical on the Table
  * similar responses. In English, polar-question confirmation, just as
    assertion confirmation, can be signaled by nodding, by saying uh huh as well
    as by assertions that repeat the previous assertion, as exemplified in (25):
  * Generalizing over assertion confirmation and polar question confirmation, we
    characterize a type of discourse move we call __confirming__ in (26):
    * difference: assertion confirmation can be left completely implicit,
      while polar question confirmation can not
      * Silence after a default polar question cannot be normally taken as confirm
  * a polar question confirmation move does not necessarily lead to agreement on
    * since the author of the q has not publicly committed to either outcome
    * agreement arises only after the author of the question confirms the resoluti
    * In the most common case, that of information seeking questions, the
      questioner/addressee is assumed not/assumed to know the answer to the questi
      => questioner's confirmation of the addressee’s answer is even less marked
      than in the case of assertions
* Reversing a polar question, just like in the case of reversing an assertion,
  * committing to ¬p, the complement of the proposition expressed by the
    sentence radical on the top of the input Table. In the case of polar
  * not a denial, however, and it does not result in a crisis
    because a default polar question does not categorically bias the context in
  * Generalizing over what is reversals of assertions and polar questions we
    define a move type we call __reversing__ as in (29):
    * simpler than reversing moves
      because the relation they involve is identity rather than complementation
      ie, the answers polar questions project are not identical even in non-bias
      since confirming answers are less marked 
    => further distinguish positive and negative polar questions
    * polar questions involve a weak bias towards the least marked answer we
    * weak bias of positive polar questions towards a positive answer, and
    * the weak bias of negative polar questions towards the negative answer
    * noticed in Rooy & Safarova (2003)
* agree not to pursue a question if there is no agreement on an answer,
  * a non-canonical way of removing an assertion from the Table, one can
  * removing it from the Table without having resolved it. Such a move is
  * no enrichment of the common ground. Once the question is removed,
  * the projected set must be recalculated. Such moves
  * may be prompted by participants declaring their inability to provide info

## 4.3 Responses to assertions vs. responses to polar questions 18

* responding assertions those assertions that perform a responding move, and
  initiating assertions those subtypes of assertions that are not responding
* Since initiating assertions and polar questions place an issue on the Table in
  the form of a proposition-denoting sentence radical, moves that react to them
  can be responding and therefore confirming or reversing. Since
* constituent questions do not place a proposition-denoting sentence radical on
  the Table, reactions to such questions can be neither confirming nor reversing
* In order to capture the common denominator of respoinding moves we propose to
  * two relative polarity features,
    [same] marking confirming moves 
    [reverse] marking reversing ones
* Recall that the crucial difference between assertions and (polar) questions is
  * commit/not their author to the propositional content of the asserted sentenc
  * confirmation in the case of assertions/polar qs amounts to agreement/not
  * reversing in the case of assertion/polar questions, amounts to denial/not
  => partial overlap in the form of responding moves reacting to either
  * We expect overlap as far as the responding nature of the move is concerned
  * diffs should be connected to the diffs in the state of the input context to
  * We discuss these predictions in more detail in the next section
