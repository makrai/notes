On Reacting to Assertions and Polar Questions
Donka F. Farkas, Kim B. Bruce

# Abstract

* capture the similarities and differences between assertions vs polar questons
  * systematic partial overlap that exists in reactions to these speech acts in
* organization
  * the discourse components we assume, and then define
  * default assertions and default polar questions in a way that allows us to
    characterize two types of responses to these speech acts,
    confirming and reversing reactions
    * The common characteristics of assertions and polar questions are
      responsible for the fact that both allow these reactions;
    * the differences between the two speech acts explain the different
      contextual effects confirming and reversing moves have depending on
      whether they react to an assertion or a polar question. We then examine
  * distribution of a set of ‘polarity’ particles in Romanian
    in terms of the notions defined in the rest of the paper, and end with
  * a series of predictions concerning polarity particles across languages.

* At the root of the ‘conversational crisis’ are the following two assumptions:
  (i) conversational changes that result in additions to commitments are less
  marked than those that result in the retraction of such commitments, and
  (ii) raising an issue steers the conversation toward a state where the issue

# 2 Context components 3

* we present a model of context structure that
  combines features of earlier proposals (Ginzburg (1996), Ginzburg (),
  Gunlogson (2001) and Asher & Lascarides (2003)),
  within the tradition of Stalnaker (1978), Hamblin (1971), and Carlson (1983).
  * to capture the similarities and differences between assertions and polar qs
* An essential component of models of context, acknowledged since the earliest:
  * representation of the discourse commitments of participants. We assume here
  * discourse commitments are propositions (i.e., sets of worlds)
    publicly taken by the participants as being true of the world of the
    conversation, from the perspective of the conversation (Sacks 1992)
* issue is how to relate discourse commitments to participants
  * Stalnaker (1978) assumes a single set of shared public commitments, the cg.
  * Hamblin (1971) and Gunlogson (2001), on the other hand,
    each participant is associated with a set of discourse commitments.
    * Gunlogson (2001) defines the common ground as an ancillary notion made up
      * the union of the participants’ commitment sets
  * Stalnaker’s cg can be defined as the intersection of these sets.
  * Ginzburg: there is
    * a common ground, called FACTS, as well as
    * a dialogue game board containing both public and private aspects
      associated with each participant in the conversation
    * Our canonical Table-emptying operations correspond to Ginzburg’s
      operations that downgrade QUD and upgrade the FACTS once a resolution of
      the issue on the Table has been agreed upon.
  * Asher & Lascarides (2003), each participant is associater with a
    Segmented Discourse Representation Structure (SDRS) that
    represents their cognitive state
    * The common ground is reconstructed via a relation, called _settled_,
      defined between a content and a discourse structure. 6 4
    * include questions that participants are committed to supplying an answer
      to as well as requests they are publicly committed to carrying out.
* We present here a model that separates a Stalnakerian cg
  from the discourse commitment set of each participant
  * The discourse commitment set of a participant A at a time t in a conversat c
    contains those propositions
    * A has publicly committed to in the course of c up to t and which have
    * not (yet) become mutual commitments.
  * The cg on the other hand, is that set of propositions that
    * have been agreed upon by all participants in c at t together with the
    * represent the shared background knowledge of the discourse participants.
* Having the cg as a separate component allows us to capture
  what Stalnaker takes the crucial effect of assertions to be, namely
  * proposing to add the propositional content of the asserted sentence to the cg
  * allows us to explain
    * that assertion acceptance is a default move rather than contradict/denial
    * the existence of conversational pressure in the direction of
      increasing the cg by turning publicized commitments into joint commitments
      * Without such pressure the Collaborative Principle of Walker (1996) would
        remain mysterious
      * requires participants to provide evidence of detected ‘discrepancy in
        belief’ as soon as possible in a conversation
      * Were it not for the drive to build a cg,
        discrepancy in publicized belief would not be problematic, and thus
        no special need of being signaled.
* Commitment sets (whether the cg or individual commitment sets)
  can be upgraded or downgraded. The former change, we take it,
  * upgrading is more canonical than the latter
  * Walker (1996): of a default rule makes beliefs persistent
  * In our terms: addition is a canonical change to a commitment set
    while retraction is not.
* More concretely, we assume that
  a discourse structure K contains
  * a (possibly empty) set of propositions DC X for each participant X in the
    conversation, made up of those propositions that
    X has publicly committed to during the conversation up to the relevant time,
    * not shared by all the other participants. In addition, K contains
  * a set of propositions, the cg, whose elements are
    those propositions that have been confirmed by all participants
    as well as a set of background propositions.
* The total discourse commitments of a discourse participant X is DC X ∪ cg. By
  * taken to be a subset of her doxastic base (cf. Grice’s Quality Maxim).
  * not required to be correct, and therefore they need not be in fact true of
  * a participant is coherent iff her total discourse commitments are consistent
    * a discourse whose cg is inconsistent is in crisis.
* Separating participants’ discourse commitments from the cg is
  essential in accounting for disagreements in ordinary discourses
  * One way a discourse may survive denial is when participants
    agree to disagree. Leaving the details for Section 4, assume now that A has
  * The state of the discourse in this case should record
    A’s commitment to p and B’s commitment to ¬p but
    neither p nor ¬p should be in the cg
  * In our model, p \in DC A , ¬p \in DC B and p, ¬p !\in the cg.
  * consistent cg and coherent participants even though DC A ∪ DC B is not consi
  * the level that counts for purposes of presupposition satisfaction in such
    cases is the cg rather than either of the participant’s commitment set.
    eg, after having agreed to disagree on whether Sam is home, it would be
    infelicitous for A to say Since Sam is home, the children are not alone
    even if A has previously committed to Sam being home.
* Ginzburg (1996), Roberts (1996), and Büring (2003), in having
  a discourse component that records the questions under discussion
  * We rechristen it the Table and assume that
    the items on it are syntactic objects paired with their denotations. Having
  * syntactic objects on the Table is needed because a grammar of
    cross-turn conversation and ellipsis has to have access to the form of
    immediately previous utterances. For
    eg, in many languages polar questions can be answered
    by repeating the main verb of the question with the same or the reverse pola
    * ‘fragment answers’ independently of the finer details of their treatment.
    => asserting a sentence such as Sam is home makes a different contribution
    to the Table from asking the question Is Sam home?, since the former adds a
* the Table is a stack of 'issues’ in the conversation
  * When the Table is not empty, the immediate goal of the conversation is to
    empty it, i.e.  to settle the issue at hand. The stack discipline
  * allows us to capture the tight connection between
    * initiating conversational moves, such as an initiating assertion or questi
    * responding moves that address the issue
      an immediately preceding utterance has placed on the Table, a matter we
* having the Table as a separate component allows us to differentiate between
  context states that can/not serve as natural endpoints of a discourse, and
  * As long as there are items on the Table, there are issues that need to be
* two fundamental engines that drive conversations are the need to
  * increase the cg. drives participants to place items on the Table;
  * reach a stable state. drives them to take the necessary steps to remove these
    * in such a way as to increase the cg. A novelty of our approach is that
  * we attempt to capture these twin goals by assuming that
    every conversational move that places an item on the Table is associated
    with a canonical way of removing that item from the Table.
* The canonical way of removing an issue from the Table is to reach a discourse
  state in which the issue is decided. A proposition
  * p is decided relative to a common ground cg if and only if
    p follows from the cg or if ¬p follows from the cg. If a proposition p is
* projectied set
  * a conversational move that places an item on the Table
    simultaneously projects a set of future common grounds
    relative to which the issue on the Table is decided
  * These projected sets are supersets of the current cg. We call these
  * the projected set (ps) is represent in a separate component. As we see in
  * an assertion projects confirmation in that it projects a future common
    ground that includes the asserted proposition
  * A question projects resolution in the sense that it projects a set of future
    common grounds arrived at by adding to each common ground in the input ps
    each (contextually) possible answer to the question
  * Assertions and questions
    * are similar in that their effect on the ps is to add their denotations to
      the elements of the input ps
    * differ in that for assertions/q, only one/set of proposition is added and
      therefore only one/set of resolution is projected
  * When the Table is empty, the ps contains the current cg as its only element.
  * otherwie, the elements of the ps are computed based on what is on the Table.
* The ps assumes a central role in our view because it is
  * the anticipatory nature of certain conversat moves is captured at this level
  * moves may steer conversations towards particular privileged futures
    is not directly represented in the conversational state
  * in Asher and Lascarides’s work, only this:
    * future moves must find a possible rhetorical relation that
      attaches them to the conversation
  * An assertion/questions may be
    * contradicted, confirmed, called into question, elaborated on or corrected
    * confirmation resp resolution is special: this is what is projected at the
      ps level.
* moves that place items on the Table define a set of conversational goal states
  reached when the item in question is removed from the Table in a way that
  maximally increases the cg
  * ps in characterizing
    * what A’s proposal is when she makes her assertion, as well as
    * what the questioner directs the conversation toward when he asks his quest
* ps allows us to import the insights of earlier work on the
  context change of assertions and questions
  * we perform these changes at the level of the ps.
    * instead of performing at the level of the cg
      (or its intersection, the context set)
* a conversation is in crisis if its cg is inconsistent or if
  all the sets in its ps are inconsistent.
  * Having at least one consistent set in the ps means that
    there are canonical moves that lead to emptying the Table
    while at the same time reaching a consistent cg.
* For the matters we discuss here, no need for further additions to context stru
  * such as the agendas of participants or representations of their private
    doxastic states
  * our model is consistent with
    expansion in these directions, as well as with
    additions of finer grained structures for dealing with anaphoric relations.
* the information we do represent is redundant for the examples we discuss. In
  * the contents of the ps can always be calculated
    from the current cg and the items on the Table.  We nevertheless
  * include it in our representation for the sake of clarity and
    for emphasizing similarities between what we propose and previous approache
* diagrams of the form below:
* DC A and DC B are the propositions A and B have individually publicly
  committed to and which are not joint commitments. The
  * cg is the set of propositions that are joint commitments of the participants
  * The contents of the Table, S, are items that are still under discussion,
  * ps is a set of common grounds that reflects canonical ways of settling the
    issues on the Table.
* notation we use throughout the rest of the paper. The table T in a context
  * to represent traditional stack operations on T :
  1. push(e, T ) represents the new stack obtained by adding item e to the top
  2. pop(T ) represents the stack obtained by popping off the top item of T .
  3. top(T ) represents the top item of the stack T .
  4. remove(e, T ) represents the stack obtained by removing the top-most
     occurrence of e from stack T .  If e does not occur in T , then T is returned.
* Lastly, let
  ps = {cg 1 ,... , cg n } be a collection of sets of propositions (e.g.,
  possible common grounds) and let
  P = {p 1 ,... , p m } be a set of propositions
  Then define ps ∪ P = {cg i ∪ {p j } | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} − {cg 0 | cg 0 is
  inconsistent}. Thus the
  * each new set is formed by adding one of the elements of P to an existing
    `cg_i` . At the end, any new sets that are inconsistent are discarded.
  * assume an operator that rebuilds the projected set ps from the current cg
    and the contents of the Table T
    by iteratively performing the ps changes associated with each item on the
    Table
    * needed after a non-canonical conversational move is made, such as
      retracting an assertion, agreeing to disagree or withdrawing a question.

# 3 Default Assertions and Default Polar Questions 7

* in order to capture the details of their similarities and differences. We take
  * explain why there is overlap in the range of reactions to them and
    why this overlap is only partial.

## 3.1 Default Assertions

* include assertions in the repertory of speech acts one defines. Obviously,
  * many subtypes of assertions, and the complex issue of drawing their typology
  * default assertion is performed when a participant X utters
    a declarative sentence S with falling intonation that not place specific
    demands on the input context
  * not addressed here, are
    ‘rising declaratives’ as well as assertions followed by interrogative tags.
* declarative and interrogative sentences are distinguished by
  the sentential features [D] and [I] respectively. We treat these features as
  * sentential markers because it is crucial to what follows for the sentence
    radical to which they attach to be accessible in subsequent discourse.
  * Hamblin (1971), that the denotation of a declarative sentence S[D] is the
    singleton set containing the proposition denoted by its sentence radical.
* Krifka (2001) (see also Ginzburg (forthcoming)) in assuming that
  there are __speech act operators__ that take sentences as arguments, and that are
  functions from input context states to output context states. We define
  * the default assertion operator A as a function from an input context K i to
    an output context K o , as in (9), where `a` is the author of the assertion,
    DC a,o and DC a,i are a’s output and input context discourse commitments,
    and T o , T i are the output and input Table, respectively:
(9) A(S[D], a, K i ) = K o such that
  (i) DC a,o = DC a,i ∪ {p}  (common to all types of assertions, default or not)
  (ii) `T o = push(<S[D]; {p}>, T i )`
  (iii) ps o = ps i ∪ {p}
* A default assertion then
  * commits its author to the propositional content of the asserted sentence,
  * raises an issue by placing an item on the Table, and
  * directs the conversation towards a unique resolution of that issue, namely
    confirmation of the assertion
* The ‘issue’ is the denotation of the sentence radical added to the Table in
  the course of the assertion
* yields an output context that is biased in favor of confirmation
* The changes A brings about echo those in Poesio & Traum (1998), where an
  assertion is defined as committing the speaker to the belief in its
  propositional content, while simultaneously attempting to get the addressee to
  believe that content as well
  * The main difference is that we are considering here changes triggered by
    particular linguistic forms that target particular conversational
    * independent of participants’ actual beliefs and intentions
  * the participant may in fact aim at provoking her interlocutor to contradict
    * aim at misleading an eavesdropper or have other complex agendas. Here
  * we are interersted in those conversational effects that are constant across
    all these situations
    and which are connected to sentence form, prosodical properties and the
    input conversation state
  * We thus define speech acts in terms of
    * their Heimean context change potential (CCP) rather than in terms of
      the actual intentions of speakers.
* We follow here Stalnaker’s suggestion that
  a side-effect of any speech act is to register in the common ground the fact
  that the speech act in question has occurred. We will ignore this effect
* For Stalnaker, the essential context change associated with assertions is the
  addition of p to the common ground
  * The parallel change for us is the addition of p to the elements of the ps.
    Not changing the current common ground directl
    leaves room for moves that react to assertions
* earlier proposals that Our view (assertions put issue on the Table) follows
  * closest to Ginzburg’s
  * For us, just as for Ginzburg, asserting a sent raises the issue of whether p
  * In our approach hE it differ how the issue is raised by a assert/polar quest
  * similarly: addition of the asserted proposition to the author’s discourse
    commitment list is the essential feature of declarative updates
* separating confirmation from all other possible moves that follow a def assert
  * a feature we exploit below in capturing differences between reactions to
    assertions and reactions to polar questions.
* default assertions may
  initiate a discourse but they may also
  connect to previous discourse by a variety of rhetorical relations of the type
  eg Elaboration or Counterevidence, focus of Asher & Lascarides (2003),
  * the veridicality of assertions, follows from the 1. and 3. change in (9)
    * veridicality is crucial in Asher & Reese (2007)
* assertions, as well as questions and other speech acts, are
  associated not only with literal content but with implicated content as well.
  * implicated content is added on the Table conjoined with but separated from
    the literal content
    making it possible for further moves to react to both implicated and literal
  * One difference between the two types of content is that
    only literal content is associated with syntactic material on the Table, and
    therefore we predict differences between them in discourse ellipsis

## 3.2 Default Polar Questions 10

* how the context changes when a polar question speech act is performed, i.e.
  * Syntactically, we represent polar interrogatives as S[I] and assume that S
  * The denotation of S[I] is {p, ¬p}
* raises the issue whether p by placing on the conversational Table the
  interrogative sentence and its denotation, namely {p, ¬p}. Placing
  * steers the conversation towards a state in which the question is resolved.
  * add to each of ps's elements each of the elements in the denotation of the
  * footnoe: Following Karttunen (1977) we assume that the denotation of an
    interrogative sentence is the set of its complete answers.
* the effect of assertions and questions on the Table and on the ps is
  identical in
  the sense that in both cases a sentence and its denotation are added to the
  Table and
  each element of the denotation of the sentence is added to each element of the
  input ps
  * The differences follow from the fact that the denotation of the declarative
    sentence is a singleton set while that of an interrogative is not
* we not keep track of who placed a particular item on the Table because nothing
  we discuss here is sensitive to this aspect. Adding such a
* We define the polar question operator PQ as in (12), where
  S[I] is a polar interrogative sentence, and where p is the denotation of S:
(12) Polar question operator (PQ)
  PQ(S[I], K i ) = K o such that
  (i) T o = push(hS[I]; {p, ¬p}i, T i )
  (ii) ps o = ps i ∪{p, ¬p}.
* The context state after a default polar question is inquisitive [kíváncsi]
  with respect to the denotation of the sentence radical the move has placed on
  the Table
  because the ps contains both future common grounds to which p/\neg p was added
* The most immediate way in which such a context is returned to a stable state
  * the addressee providing a complete direct answer to the question followed by
  * a confirmation of this answer by the participants in the conversation, which
  * leads to the addition of the answer to the cg. If this happens, the common
  * getting the question removed from the Table. The goal of the conversation
* Default polar questions are non-biasing in the sense that
  they do not commit their author to either proposition in their denotation
  * project an inquisitive context with respect to their sentence radical.
  * There are hE non-default polar questions that are not impartial.
    * In English, polar interrogatives involving external negation, as
      (13) Isn’t Sam home?
    * have been treated as involving some sort of pre-existing bias on the part
    * footnote: questions that introduce strong bias are non-default.
      * We come back to weak bias involved in positive and in inner negation
        polar questions in Section 4.2.
    * in favor of the proposition in the scope of the negative operator, i.e.,
    * issue is much debated (van Rooy & Safarova (2003), Romero & Han (2004))
* the two speech acts we are concerned with in this paper contrast in
  both whether they affect author commitment and in how they affect the ps.
  * Default assertions/polar questions add/not to author commitment and
    project a non/inquisitive ps
  * Non-default assertions and non-default polar questions can depart from their
    default counterparts in either property. In order to characterize the many
* non-default questions
  * The most often discussed are those involving some bias.
  * indicates that
    settling the issue is not necessarily a projected conversational future, and
    therefore that answering the question is optional
    * In Romanian, such questions are signaled by the presence of the particle
      _oare_:
    * the output ps includes
      not only projected common grounds in which the question is decided but
      also a copy of the elements of the input ps thereby indicating that
      not answering the question is one of the projected discourse futures. Such
    * not appropriate on forms, as exam questions or as questions asked in court
* positive vs negative polar questions
  * a welcome consequence of our approach to polar questions. Having the uttered
  * differentiate between positive and negative polar questions
    while at the same time assigning them the same denotation.
  * An (inner negation) negative polar question such as: _Is Sam not home?_
  * the same effect on the ps
  * difference: neg places a negative rather than a positive sentence on the
    Table
  * Pragmatic differences as well as differences in the way they can be answered
    are connected to the difference in the contribution to the Table
  * without having to give up the uniform account of their denotation
* To sum up, the major
  * differences between default assertions vs (polar) questis
    * default assertions upgrade their author’s commitment list while default
      (polar) questions do not;
    * default assertions enter a declarative sentence on the Table, while
      polar questions enter an interrogative sentence;
    * at the level of the ps, default
      assertions result in a non-inquisitive context whereas default
      questions result in an inquisitive one. The major
  * similarity between
    asserting a sentence S[D] and asking the corresponding polar question by
    uttering S[I] is
    that the same sentence radical, S, is placed on the Table.  The major
  * difference between S[D] and S[I] is that the denotation of
    D is a singleton and that of I is not.
  * In both cases the sentence radical is decided relative to each element of
    the output ps
  * Reactions to these two speech acts, we predict, will be sensitive to this
