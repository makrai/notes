#Abstract

* document classification tasks: sentiment and topic
* In our setting, only an English training dataset is available and our aim is
  to get a classifier which works on Hungarian documents
* two different approaches for word embedding-based language adaptation methods
* evaluated along with monolingual methods in a
  * sentiment classification and a
  * topic classification dataset

#3 Evaluation Datasets

* two types of classification tasks, sentiment and topic classification. In
  each case, we worked on user generated short texts from social media. Both
  datasets are binary classification problems
