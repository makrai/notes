## 1.5 The algebra of definitions

### 5. MarkedClause ÑDefaultClause|PositionClause|ComplexClause|Clause

* Position clauses, just as `mark_`, are language-specific. They are used in a
* we abstract away from a great deal of micro-syntax, since most of the
  ‘tinkering’ is both highly syntactic and highly language-specific, while our
  focus is with the semantic and the universal.

### 7. PositionClause Ñ PositionMarker mark_ UnaryAtom

* `mark_` is a semi-technical mark term, the closest we will get to
* the Sausserean sign: its agent is a sign, its patient is a meaning, and it
* A typical example would be in the last clause defining the English word _buy_
  * =agt receive =pat, =agt pay seller, "from _" mark_ seller. 
  * discussed in 1.4
  * Whatever follows the string “from” is the seller in English
  * in Hungarian it would be whatever precedes the ablative case marker

# 2 From morphology to syntax

## 2.1 Lexical categories and subcategories

* we have much to say about events, actions, and event structure
  in 3.2 and 6.1,

## 2.2 Bound morphemes

* The causative element in _-ize_ is well known (Lieber, 1992; Plag, 1998), and
* the idea that we define certain verbs by their result state is standard

## 2.3 Relations

## 2.4 Linking (causation is also in this section) 55

* `mark_`
* Let us turn to an explanation for more abstract, non-spatial binaries (p58)
  * eg `for_, has, ins_, lack, mark_` and others 
    * korábban e.g. CAUSE, ER, FOR, HAS, INSTRUMENT, LACK, MARK, `PART_OF`
  * using purposive `for_` as our example

### the linkers, the most recalcitrant of our primitives (line 1438, page 63)

* more abstract, notional binaries
  e.g. CAUSE, ER, FOR, HAS, INSTRUMENT, LACK, MARK, PART_OF
  * defer MARK to 2.5, and
  * Chapter 4: our negation operator LACK
* We begin with purposives: FOR, INSTRUMENT
* CAUSE
  * we define x cause_ y by cause_ x before y, after(y)
  * This falls quite short of a proper analysis of single and multiple causes,
    * encourages precisely the kind of errors that are rampant in the
      identification of cause-effect relations. But there is no reason to
    * sophisticated data analysis of the kind urged in (Pearl, 2009) cannot be
      replicated in natural language semantics, especially as
      * the kind of statistics and probability theory that undergird the modern
        scientific understanding are not supported by natural language (Ch 5)
  * We compare the commonsensical definition of causation to the counterfactual
    sine qua non definition in Chapter 6
* `PART_OF`, HAS
* We also explained how
  the mainstays of case/valency systems, such as datives, locatives, and ins,
  can be reconstructed without assuming link types beyond ‘1’ and ‘2’,
  by taking these as relationals that typecast their arguments
* we compare 4lang to UD 48
* assume that link types are acting as variable-binding term operators (VBTOs)
  so that we would have not just =agt and =pat, but also =goal, =source,
  =theme, =pos and perhaps several others
* In earlier versions of 4lang (Makrai 2014): several thematic role-like constr
  * hE this really stretched the ontological committment (Quine 1947) of the
    model beyond what is absolutely necessary

## 2.5 Naive grammar 57

* Many of our lexical entries do double duty as elements of p64
  the universal conceptual schema / the naive theory of grammar
* in `cause_` the underscore signifies that we are interested in a substantive,
  if naive, theory of causation, something that
  * must be available to support all kinds of decompositional analyses e.g kill
    means ‘cause to die’
  * the common decompositional style of lexical analysis relies on primitives
    like MOVE; BECOME; DO; and others,
  * 4lang simply uses ordinary lexical entries _move_ `before(=agt at place/10`
  * often the distinction between the ‘grammatical’ and the ‘ordinary’ use is
    so slight that we see no reason to even make the distinction:
  * eg part_of (discussed in 2.4 above) and is_a
* The U/V (intransitive/transitive) distinction (p71)
* Since our goals are remarkably close, and our motivations are nearly (p72)
  identical, readers of Jackendoff and Audring (2020) may find a direct
  comparison between the two formalisms helpful
  * Turning to the semantic component,
    we avoid the system of linking and coindexation that J&A 4.13.1 rely on
    (the equalizers introduced in 3.3 will to some extent make up for this
    loss)

# 3 Time and space

3.1 Space
3.2 Time
3.3 Indexicals, coercion
3.4 Measure

# 4 Negation

* Here we take advantage of the mechanism that we have at our disposal
  independent of negation and quantification, thematic roles (Dowty, 1986) and
  the fact that we already have a fundamental is_a

# 5 Probabilistic reasoning

# 6 Modals and counterfactuality

##6.1 Tense and aspect 

##6.2 The deontic world (The instrumental is also discussed here)

* This again illustrates a point we already made at the end of 6.1: it is the
  lexical semantics of the elements such as the instrumental case marker ins_,
  defined as =pat make ins_ =agt[easy] that drives the way instruments are
  referred to in language, not some top-down theory (such as hierarchical
  ordering of thematic roles). This is not to say that conceptual definitions
  such as Fillmore’s “The case of the inanimate force or object causally
  involved in the action or state identified by the verb” or Pān.ini’s “most
  effective means” are useless. To the contrary, these are both powerful
  paraphrases for trying to get to the meaning of the instrumental marker, and
  for the analytically minded, they provide excellent guidance in trying to
  sort out what (if anything) can be considered an instrument in a given
  situation. Our own definitional attempt differs from these chiefly in being
  provided in a fully formalized language, in keeping with the overall plan of
  the work.
