## 2.1 Lexical categories and subcategories

* we have much to say about events, actions, and event structure
in 3.2 and 6.1,

## 2.4 Linking (line 1114)

### the linkers, the most recalcitrant of our primitives (line 1438, page 63)

* more abstract, notional binaries
  e.g. CAUSE, ER, FOR, HAS, INSTRUMENT, LACK, MARK, PART_OF
  * defer MARK to 2.5, and
  * Chapter 4: our negation operator LACK
* We begin with purposives: FOR, INSTRUMENT
* CAUSE
* `PART_OF`, HAS
* We also explained how
  the mainstays of case/valency systems, such as datives, locatives, and ins,
  can be reconstructed without assuming link types beyond ‘1’ and ‘2’,
  by taking these as relationals that typecast their arguments
* we compare 4lang to UD 48
* assume that link types are acting as variable-binding term operators (VBTOs)
  so that we would have not just =agt and =pat, but also =goal, =source,
  =theme, =pos and perhaps several others
* In earlier versions of 4lang, Makrai (2014) used several thematic role-like
  constructs, but this really stretched the ontological committment (Quine
  1947) of the model beyond what is absolutely necessary

## 2.5 Naive grammar 57

* Since our goals are remarkably close, and our motivations are nearly
  identical, readers of Jackendoff and Audring (2020) may find a direct
  comparison between the two formalisms helpful
  * Turning to the semantic component,
    we avoid the system of linking and coindexation that J&A 4.13.1 rely on
    (the equalizers introduced in 3.3 will to some extent make up for this loss)

# 3 Temporal and spatial semantics

# 4 Negation

* Here we take advantage of the mechanism that we have at our disposal
  independent of negation and quantification, thematic roles (Dowty, 1986) and
  the fact that we already have a fundamental is_a

# 5 Probabilistic reasoning

# 6 Modals and counterfactuality

* This again illustrates a point we already made at the end of 6.1: it is the
  lexical semantics of the elements such as the instrumental case marker ins_,
  defined as =pat make ins_ =agt[easy] that drives the way instruments are
  referred to in language, not some top-down theory (such as hierarchical
  ordering of thematic roles). This is not to say that conceptual definitions
  such as Fillmore’s “The case of the inanimate force or object causally
  involved in the action or state identified by the verb” or Pān.ini’s “most
  effective means” are useless. To the contrary, these are both powerful
  paraphrases for trying to get to the meaning of the instrumental marker, and
  for the analytically minded, they provide excellent guidance in trying to
  sort out what (if anything) can be considered an instrument in a given
  situation. Our own definitional attempt differs from these chiefly in being
  provided in a fully formalized language, in keeping with the overall plan of
  the work.
