## 2.4 Linking

* more abstract, notional binaries 
  e.g. CAUSE, ER, FOR, HAS, INSTRUMENT, LACK, MARK, PART_OF
  * defer MARK to 2.5, and devote the entire 
  * Chapter 4 to our negation operator LACK. 
* We begin with purposives: FOR, INSTRUMENT
* CAUSE
* `PART_OF`, HAS
* We also explained how 
  the mainstays of case/valency systems, such as datives, locatives, and ins,
  can be reconstructed without assuming link types beyond ‘1’ and ‘2’, 
  by taking these as relationals that typecast their arguments
* we compare 4lang to UD 48
* In earlier versions of 4lang, Makrai (2014) used several thematic role-like
  constructs, but this really stretched the ontological committment (Quine 1947)
  of the model beyond what is absolutely necessary

## 2.5 Naive grammar 57

* Since our goals are remarkably close, and our motivations are nearly
  identical, readers of Jackendoff and Audring (2020) may find a direct
  comparison between the two formalisms helpful
